## The Lean Six Sigma Toolkit

- The Lean Six Sigma Toolkit. Now in the past ten years, the lean thinking and the Six Sigma movement have kind of joined forces and created a new discipline in and of itself. It uses the goals of lean And the standardized way to attack and solve problems of six Sigma to create a unified view of how to improve processes in a company. The five whys is a problem solving technique that was developed by the Toyota Motor Corporation. It's simple. You ask five why's and you get the actual root cause of a problem. It's really more of a philosophy rather than a scientific approach, but it works.

- If you look at the cars they're flawless. There are no production errors present whatsoever. So when the customer buys them, they work as they were intended to. People do not feel, processes do. If you fix the process, people would behave accordingly and deliver the desired outcome. Now, there's a more formalized way to get to the root cause of a problem which is called the fish pond diagram or Ishikawa diagram named after its inventor. In the fish pond diagram, we're graphically depicting the six different areas where problems can emerge.
- Can be the people who are involved with the process, the methods they use, the machine, the materials they work on, the data that is gathered or the environment at large. If you look in all of these six areas successively, you'll probably find the root cause of your problem. And don't forget, the first issue that arises may not be the root cause and you need to dig deeper. 5S is a methodology to organize and improve your workplace for efficiency and effectiveness. It's made up of five steps. Number one, you sort. You remove all unnecessary items from your workplace.

- If you don't use it, you don't need it on your desk. Second, you set in order. You organize your work space and your tools in such a way as you can retrieve them in a best way possible. Third, shine. You clean and inspect your work space and every tool within it and make sure everything is in perfect working order. Fourth, standardize. You make sure you have one way of putting everything away and it stays that way.
- And fifth, sustain. You create a system that makes you do this process over and over. For example you draw the outlines of the tools on the back of a cabinet. This not only enhances your work space, but it also enhances the productivity of the workers within it. If there's a problem in the supply chain, the solution is going to be found in the supply chain. You cannot solve a problem by sitting behind your desk and staring at your computer screen. Genchi Genbutsu is a Japanese term that can be loosely translated as get your boots on.
- You want to go there to the place where the problem occurs, also known as Gemba, and see for yourself. And only then can you really solve problems effectively.

## Selecting a Great Lean Six Sigma Project

Dear learners,
now that you have almost reached the end of this course, you may wonder what it takes to complete the final project.  Well, you are going to attempt to improve a process in your own environment. This process could be something that occurs at work. 

In business, there are generally three types of projects:

Investment Projects (replace all computers with tablets for certain employees)      

Innovation Projects (develop a new product, service, or enter a new market.)     

Problem Solving Projects (determine the root cause of transportation issue)

Additional Ideas:

1. Six Sigma Projects - https://www.isixsigma.com/project-selection-tracking/finding-and-selecting-good-six-sigma-projects/
2. 15 Criteria for Selecting a Viable DMAIC Project - while much more complex than what I am looking for, this is a nice method to select among alternate projects. - https://www.isixsigma.com/project-selection-tracking/15-criteria-selecting-viable-dmaic-project/

For those of you who are not able to find anything at work that you can use for this course, I would ask you to search for something in your personal life. It is not critical that it is a big project, but it should be something that is meaningful in a way.

As silly as this article looks to some, I believe that anyone who is able to perform any of these projects would enhance their understanding of Lean Six Sigma. - https://goleansixsigma.com/10-ways-lean-six-sigma-helps-organize-your-home/

In general, here may be some helpful guidelines for selecting a good project:

Develop a direct linkage to the strategic goals of the organization (or yourself). 

Directly affect key business objectives (what is important to you?).

Attempt to improve a process in a measurable way. If it cannot be measured, then it is not a meaningful project.

Derive direct benefits to key stakeholders (customers, suppliers, etc.)

Now it is your turn:

Select your own Lean Six Sigma project!
