## What is Supply Chain Operations?

- Ever wonder how Toyota became the largest car maker in the world? Or how many lemons get thrown out for every pitcher of lemonade? Supply chain operations makes all of this possible. It makes it efficient for manufacturers to create perfect products while reducing waste in a global economy. I'm Rudi Leuschner with Rutgers Business School, and I'm excited to teach you about operations. [MUSIC] Smooth operations. [MUSIC] Every company's success, from GE to Toyota, is built upon its ability to transform raw materials and knowledge through efficient processes into finished goods and services.
- The smoother the operation, the more perfect the product, the happier you the consumer will be. If you're considering a career in supply chain management, or already in the field, or simply fascinated by how to improve and streamline efficient operational processes, this course is for you.

Why Supply Chain Operations?
Operations is defined as the process of transforming raw materials into finished goods. Therefore, the study of operations is essential in today's  global interconnected supply chains, where customers are seeking the best products at the lowest cost.

An Introduction to Operations
In  this introductory Supply Chain Operations course, I will take you on a journey to this fascinating  backbone of global trade. Please note that the idea for this course is  to introduce learners to logistics. While I am planning to cover the  most important pieces, this is not meant to be exhaustive nor should you  expect to be an expert upon completion. But my goal is to show the  major pieces of operations in a fun manner and hopefully this will  encourage you to learn more.

What topics will you cover?
We cover the three major tools of operations :

Lean Operations and Theory of Constraints

Inventory Optimization (Economic Order Quantity, Safety Stock, Lead-Time-Demand)

Lean Inventory

Six Sigma

Lean Six Sigma

What will I be able to do upon completing this course?
After  completing this course, you will be able to differentiate the advantages  and disadvantages of different modes of transportation. 

You will  understand what goes into designing and setting up a warehousing  facility. 

You will be able to select the options that enable  you to develop logistics networks, that minimize costs and deliver top  customer service. 

Who is this course for?
This  introductory course is designed for three general audiences. While this  is not an exhaustive list, you should be able to see yourself in one of  these three groups: 

Those of you who are exploring a career  in Supply Chain Management, but lack the any background. This course  will provide you with a general overview of the field of operations.

Those of you who are working with people in operations and want to understand their daily challenges better. 

Those  of you who are fascinated by how basic inputs (raw materials and labor) are transformed into finished products and services.

What do I need to start?
This  is an introductory course designed to provide you  with a start on your learning journey in operations. As such,  you do not need to  have any background in operations, but it would be beneficial if you had a  basic understanding of:

## The Goals of Operations: Speed, Flexibility, Quality, and Cost

- The Goals of Operations. In supply chain, operation refers to the process of transformation. We transform input, raw material, machinery, and labor into outputs, our finished products. When we look at how to make operations better, we focus on four primary goals. Cost, quality, speed, and flexibility. Now in reality, most companies will focus on a number of these goals, but you have to make trade-offs. For example, your priorities will be different if you make $100 pens such as this one, versus $0.25 pens such as this one.
- You can achieve this by creating economies of scale. That is, you make a lot more and each unit will be cheaper to produce. There are over 6,000 Walmart stores all over the world. If you want to sell your products here, your main operation's objective will be how to make your product at the lowest cost. And you can achieve this through economies of scale. A cheaper product will be more attractive to customers and more of them will buy it. You're going to earn more money on each unit because it's cheaper, and you're going to sell a lot more.
- Therefore, your profit will be much larger. [SOUND] Time is money. Most companies do not have unlimited resources. You only have so much capital. You only have so much land. You only have so much machinery to build with. So if you want to produce more product, you have to be able to do it faster.
- Companies such as Zara have made speed their priority. And they've gained a competitive advantage by being able to see trends in the marketplace and react to them very quickly. Zara can bring a brand new product on to the marketplace much faster than most of their competitors can, and that enabled them to grow into one of the largest clothing retailers in the world. [SOUND] Quality control is another important objective in some companies' business model. For example, Motorola was the winner of the first Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award, which was awarded to companies that have made quality one of their key priorities throughout their organization. Motorola's goal was to produce perfect products across the organization. That has several benefits.
- Not only did they not waste resources in producing items that were going to be defective, but they also saved a lot of time. And it saved them money in the end, because you don't just have to throw out products. Because consumer needs change over time, some companies choose to prioritize flexible manufacturing systems. Otherwise, you could just focus on cost, speed, and quality alone. What I'm talking about is a manufacturing system that is able to produce ion item or 10,000 items and just as efficiently. And most traditional manufacturing systems are really just made for one speed and one speed only. If you push them too fast or make them go too slow, they don't work very well.
- Now how do companies make their operations better? They use of technique called optimization. Now in optimization, you have to define your objective. It may be to minimize cost, increase speed, achieve perfect quality or more flexibility, nevertheless, you have certain parameters that you can change. You change the way you use machinery. You can change the order of production. You can change what level you use for each machine.
- But, you cannot change them too much. There are certain constraints placed on your operations. You can't just build another factory. So within those parameters and constraints, you're seeking to find the best solution possible. And that is how you get your operations to be more efficient and more effective.

## Lean Operations

- Lean operations, lean is a management philosophy that has its roots in the Toyota production system. The goal is to produce as much product given a set of resources. So it's a very effective system of production. Now, how did this system of production come about? Toyota traces its roots producing cars back to the 1940s. And at that time, in war-torn, post-World War II Japan, there are not many resources available. Toyota was a small car maker, they have just completed 2,500 cars.
- They went to see Ford, who was producing 8,000 cars a day. And what they saw was the marvel of production technology of that time, which was the River Rouge plant in Dearborn, Michigan. Now that production system was great for Ford, but it didn't work in Japan. Japan is a small island with lots of mountains, and they couldn't build such large factories. They also didn't have a lot of money to build up all that inventory that Henry Ford had. Therefore, they took some ideas and thought about how to do it differently. And the result was the Toyota production system, which propelled them to become the largest car manufacturer in the world today.
- Now this road to become the largest car maker in the world was a long one. However, Toyota experienced tremendous growth in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. And this growth can be attributed to two central tendencies in their production system. One is the concept of Kaizen, and that means continuous improvement. If there is a quality issue, every worker has the power to stop the line and investigate and fix the problem right there as it occurs. The other one is the elimination of waste. And in the traditional philosophy there are seven wastes that must be eliminated, and I'll explain them in a second.
- Now the goal of the production system is to be as effective as possible. To produce the best products with the least amount of resources possible. In the Toyota production system there's seven types of waste that we seek to eliminate. The first one is transportation. Moving product just for the sake of moving it is not necessary. The second one is inventory. Inventory without a customer adds no value.
- The third one is motion. Moving machines or people in order to work on a product does not add value. The fourth one is waiting. And waiting doesn't help anybody. The fifth one is overproduction. Overproduction, because the quality is poor and you need to produce more is a waste. Over processing, because you have to rework a poorly manufactured product is also wasteful.

- And finally, defects that arise during the production process do not add any value and should be eliminated as much as possible. [FOREIGN], which is a term in Japanese for waste, has to be eliminated from the production process. And if you're able to eliminate it effectively, that is how you create a good manufacturing system. Two MIT researchers wanted to investigate the auto industry. And after looking at all of the big car makers, they came away with the idea that Toyota's system was the only one worth replicating. And they wrote up a book entitled The Machine that Changed the World. A few years later, they wrote another book called Lean Thinking, which really started to revolutionize the idea of lean.
- In their book, they provide five central lessons of lean. Number 1, you want to specify value from the customer's perspective. Number 2, you look at your whole supply chain and you map out where that value is created. You create a value stream map. Number 3, you want to make that value flow. In other words, you discontinue all activities that do not add value, and accelerate the activities that do add value. Fourth, you want to pull back from the customer.
- And that is a very important idea. Rather than producing and hoping that your customer will buy the product, ie pushing the product onto the customer, you want to wait for the customer to ask for a product and then you start producing it. And finally, you want to strive for perfection and eliminate all defects. This system around these five central ideas have become a standard for many organizations throughout the world.

## "Lean Thinking" by Womack and Jones

Summary of Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth in Your Corporation
by James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones.

Dear Learners,

I think this book is an excellent read for all of you. I do know that some of you do not have the time or resources to obtain and read it. Therefore, I provided you with a quick summary for the book.  You will also be able to find additional summaries online if you want a more in-depth perspective.

The 5 Lean Principles: 
Define value from the customer's perspective.

Identify the Value Stream

Make Value Flow

Pull from the Customer Back

Strive for Perfection

Define value 
“The critical starting point for lean  thinking is value”, the authors say. 

The value is set by the customer. In other words, what product and/or service are they willing to pay for. Anything that does not fit into that description, is not value.

According to the authors: “Lean thinking therefore must start  with a conscious attempt to precisely define value in terms of specific  products  with specific capabilities offered at specific prices through a  dialogue with specific customers.”

The status quo is that manufacturers make what  they make without regard what the needs of the customer are. Often customers are not aware of what to ask of the products they  are getting. 

Lean Thinking requires companies to discover what customers believe satisfies their needs.

Identify the Value Stream
The value stream is defined as all activities that add up source, make, and deliver a product to customers. With that in mind, we must identify activities that add value and waste (muda). There are two types:

Type 1 muda: create no value but unavoidable with current technology

Type 2 muda: create no value and are avoidable

Make Value Flow
After eliminating all possible waste (Type 1 muda) in the value stream, you must make the value-added steps work together continuously (no waiting, stopping, or rework). Several things to consider:

Set up just-in-time production and deliveries.

Eliminate specialized departments.

Focus on the end-product itself and what is required to complete a single product.

Ignore boundaries between  companies, departments, and individual roles with the goal of “removing all impediments to the continuous flow  of the specific product.”

Redesign processes so production of the product can flow continuously.

Pull from the Customer Back
The goal is to deliver only what customers want and when they want it (Pull), rather than pushing products out and  guessing that customers might want them.

For example: “No one upstream should produce a good or service until the customer downstream asks for it.”

Real-time signals indicate to upstream activities when more is needed.

Strive for Perfection
The improvement of processes never ends: you must always strive to source, make, and deliver a better product while improving efficiency.

“Form a vision, select the two or  three most important steps to get you there, and defer the other steps  until later.” 

Don’t settle for just being better than your current competition, because someone will come along and top you.

Practice transparency across the entire value  stream to discover opportunities for improvement.

## Theory of Constraints

- Theory of Constraints. Unlike the Toyota production system, where we seek to eliminate waste through continuous improvement, there's another philosophy called the theory of constraints. And it seeks to remove constraints from our production system that enables us to produce the most with the given resources. In this theory of constraints, we identify constraints by measuring variation on three different items. One is inventory, what we put into our production system. The second one is throughput, the products that our customers buy ultimately, and operational expense, which is the money spent on converting inventory into throughput. And the goal is to eliminate as many constraints as possible as to achieve the highest throughput.

<img width="1919" height="842" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4389812-83a1-420e-8e55-36432ed09c63" />

- Now you may wonder, what is a constraint? There are three classes of constraints that the theory identifies. One is machinery. Machines can operate only at a certain speed. The second one is people, and especially skilled people that can operate those machines well. And finally there's policies. Sometimes they may hinder the throughput of a system.
- The goal of management is to use these constraints to elevate the performance of our manufacturing system. Now how do we get rid of these constraints? Well, there is a five step procedure. First, you start by identifying what factor in your production system is a constraint. Then you have to elevate the performance of the constraints i.e., make that piece of your system work better. Sometimes what you have to do is make other parts of your system worse, in order to allow that one piece to work better. It's counterintuitive, but making some pieces of your system worse off to help improve the performance of that limiting constraint actually improves the whole system overall.

<img width="1917" height="826" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cd47dd2-2b97-4e55-a585-65301a89d503" />

- Finally, you go in and eliminate that one constraint. Your system's performance is better and you have to go back out and find the new constraint that limits the total output of your system. And you have to make sure you don't revert back to your old ways that enabled that one constraint to actually be a limiting factor. There is an example in the book that highlights an important principle about production system. And, in that example, the protagonist takes his son and a group of boy scouts on a hike. Now what he notices is that some kids are walking a lot faster than others. But as a group, they walk very slowly.
- This is similar to a production system in a factory. Some machines work very fast, some machines work very slow, but the slow ones are the ones that limit the entire system from producing more. What he thinks about is called the drum buffer rope system. And that helps us eliminate constraints, and increase the performance of the system. So, you have a drum, [SOUND] and that gives us the tap speed of the whole factory, which should never be faster than the slowest machine or the bottleneck. Then, there is the buffer and we place buffers in front of our bottleneck machines, so that we can be assured that they never run out of material to produce. Because if you have that machine waiting and has a critical impact on the entire system.
- And then finally, he tied a rope around the waist of all the boys to make them go at the same speed. So, you can limit the amount of working process in the whole system to make sure that the system produces at exactly the same speed. And that's the drum, buffer, rope system that helps us identify constraints and elevates our system's performance.
