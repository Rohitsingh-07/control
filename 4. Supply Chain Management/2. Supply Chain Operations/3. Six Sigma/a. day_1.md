# Six Sigma

## From "Quality is Free" to "Six Sigma"

- From Quality is Free to Six Sigma. >> What can we do to work smarter, not harder? >> Japan needed to do this for survival. >> Japan did it, we can do it. >> We make steel at a lower cost than any steel company in the world, including the Japanese. [SOUND] >> During the 1970s and 1980s, there was a lot of change in the United States in terms of manufacturing. American manufacturers were losing to their Japanese competitors.
- And most of it was based around the fact that Japanese products had superior quality, whereas in the US up until that point, the thinking was that cost dominated all other considerations. And quality was just adding costs. In 1980, there was a documentary entitled, If Japan Can, Why Can't We? And that really is credited with starting the quality movement in the United States. Just a year earlier, Phil Crosby published his book, Quality is Free, in which he outlined that adding quality to your production system does not add cost. In fact, it's free, because you don't produce defective products and therefore, you don't need to spend money weeding them out either. And building in quality is equally costly to throwing out defective products.
- A few years after these books and documentaries, new approaches to quality management emerged. And it also marked the time of rediscovering old forgotten quality gurus such as Edward Deming, Joseph Juran, and Kaoru Ishikawa. In fact, Deming had been instrumental in teaching Japanese manufacturers about quality in the 1950s, when they started to rebuild their manufacturing prowess. Let me discuss three different approaches to quality management. The first one is total quality management. And TQM, as it's known, has four steps. First, quality as defined by the customers' requirements.
- So whatever the customers are expecting, the company is supposed to deliver. Second, quality is part of the top management's responsibility. And they're supposed to spread it throughout the organization. Third, you improve quality through a systematic analysis of the products and the work processes. And fourth, quality improvement is a continuous effort that spreads throughout the entire organization. Another quality control system is the ISO 9000 Family of Standards. And what that does is, it certifies to the outside world that you have achieved a minimum level of quality within your production systems and throughout your organization.
- That standard is evaluated by third parties that are objective, and you cannot just make up that certification. In addition, you're required to have your entire supply base be certified in order to gain the certification yourself. It's one of these international standards that is broadcasted throughout the world, and that many companies are proud to display on their communication materials and even their outside buildings. And finally, there is the Six Sigma philosophy for quality improvement. It was first developed in 1986 by engineer Bill Smith, who worked at Motorola, and was quickly adopted throughout the entire organization. And then, other organizations started picking up on it, such as General Electric, under Jack Welsh. What Six Sigma refers to is the error free rate.
- So in any process, you're going to aim for six standard deviations of defect free products. That translates to 99.999966% error free rate, or 3.4 defects in every million products produced. The Six Sigma methodology relies on a five step method to improve a process. It starts with defining the problem, measuring it, analyzing it, improving and controlling the process. Every company says they believe in quality, but it really depends on the industry. Take for example this latte Brett just bought. It's pretty good.
- But I wish it had more foam. Now in this industry, it doesn't matter, because they'll just remake the drink. But in other industries, for example, if you buy a defibrillator, it's really a matter of life and death. You cannot afford for a product to fail.

## DMAIC and the Define Stage

- DMAIC and the Define Stage. To achieve the six sigma level of quality, companies have used a standardized process to drive their improvement projects. The DMAIC cycle is made up of five stages Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. This has been used by thousands of companies all over the world to achieve near perfection. Step one, define. In the first step, define, we have to set our goals for the improvement effort. In other words, we have to clearly state how this problem affects the customer.
- Then we have to list and gather our available resources, build our team and establish a timeline. Let me show you how this works in an example. Assume we already have a logistics network with three warehouse, trying to supply to ten different customers throughout the United States. But our goal has to be to match Amazon's Prime delivery service, which promises customers they receive their shipments in two days. [SOUND] Now with this current network, using ground delivery, it is not possible. So our goal for this project will be to achieve two-day delivery with the fewest number of warehouses possible. To finish up the define stage, we need to create a project charter.
- This is used in many organizations as a formalized document that shows what the project is about, what it's trying to achieve, and how it's trying to achieve it. There are many formats for this project charter. But typically you'd have something about the goals and objectives, the scope of the project, project milestones, and a projected budget.

## Screencast of DMAIC and the Measure Stage

- DMAIC and the Measure Stage. In the previous lecture, we talked about defining the problem in the DMAIC methodology for solving business problems and improving processes, and ultimately achieving better quality. In this lecture, what we're focusing on is measuring the problem. So as I told you already, we have built this map of a logistics network in the supply chain logistics course. In this course, we're going to focus on making it better. Now, as I said earlier, we're trying to have customers receive their orders within two days. And typically, to receive an order within two days, we're looking at a lead time.
- In order for a customer to be able to receive their order within two days, they have to be located no more than 500 miles from our warehouse. That’s the rule of thumb that most transportation companies use for two day delivery. Because line haul will be done in day one and then the local delivery will be done in day two. So as we look at this map, ten cities, three warehouses. Let's quickly determine whether we are able to deliver to all of our customers in those ten cities within two days. So we start from the east coast. And we can actually use this nifty little function to measure the distance between our warehouse and Boston, that's 278 miles.
- Road mileage will be a little further. But direct line gives us a pretty good idea. New York will be somewhere around 111, 112 miles. Philadelphia will be 85 miles. Washington DC will be 150 miles. So this eastern Pennsylvania warehouse is suitably located to hit all of our four target cities within those two days. Now let's take a look at the central warehouse, and that's supposed to deliver to Chicago.
- And that's 426 miles. To Atlanta, that is 181 miles. And Miami, Florida, is 785 miles. So here we already see this is too far to deliver within two days. The truck will stop somewhere before Orlando in day one because the driver runs out of hours to drive, and they have to stop. So it adds an extra day in this case. So the Miami customer base needs to be fulfilled from somewhere else within a 500 mile radius.
- Let's take a look at Houston. And that's 178 miles from our warehouse near San Antonio. Dallas, 237 miles. So that is okay. And then we have to deliver to Los Angeles. And here we see that it's over 1,200 miles, so there's no way a truck can make it within two driving days. So we've identified two target cities, Los Angeles and Miami, that need to have warehouses located closer so we can achieve our goal of having a warehouse network that fulfills two customers within two days.

## Screencast of DMAIC and the Analyze Stage

- DMAIC and the Analyze Stage. What I did here was to look at a couple of possible warehouses that we had on our previous list, and typically those are Amazon facilities. I'm looking at Los Angeles, specifically City Hall in Los Angeles. And here is the distance between the warehouse at certain locations and City Hall in LA. Now we see there are several ones in Phoenix, and one is in northern California, and two are in southern California, close to LA. So the task will be to pick a location that is best suited to have our warehouse. If you want extremely quick delivery, we would pick something in the LA area.
- If we want to think about future expansion, we might consider something like this in northern California. Or if we think we're going to first expand into Arizona then we would pick something in Phoenix. Which yes it's farther away, but it still fulfills our desire to have a warehouse that can deliver within two days to our customers. And we set ourselves up for the future. So we have to weigh several options in this case. And one of them, just to summarize, will be to stay in LA and deliver to there. The other one would be to have a warehouse in northern California, which can also deliver to the San Francisco area.
- But there will probably be a little bit further away from Phoenix. And both San Francisco and Phoenix are fairly big sized areas. And then finally would be to have a warehouse located in Pheonix, which would then deliver initially to LA. But when we expand to Phoenix it would deliver to Phoenix as well as to San Francisco. Now looking at those distances, to me it seems logical that we would take one of the two Los Angeles locations because they are within 360 miles from Phoenix. They're within 325, 330, maybe 350 miles from San Francisco. So you know you already have LA covered within a day really.
- And you know Phoenix doesn't add more than two days, San Francisco doesn't add more than two days. It actually is a location that fulfills our needs into the future, already. So if you narrow down your choices between these two locations, the only thing that remains is to look which location has capacity available. And which capacity would be more cost effective or more convenient looking at other factors. Now if we take a look at Miami. As we locate Miami, we have several locations that we could consider. One location is in Georgia, one is in Florida in Lakeland, Florida, one is in Ruskin, Florida.
- We quickly can see that the Georgia location is still not within 500 miles so it has to be one of the two Florida locations. And picking between the two again really just becomes a matter of convenience or whatever is cheaper. The nice thing about both of those locations is that they're also within 500 miles of Atlanta. So Atlanta now, in our network, really becomes a situation where we can deliver from two warehouses within 500 miles. Now, that may seem like overkill, but looking at the population and looking at possible other cities we might want to expand to, this is actually a fairly good situation. We can reach Chicago with in 500 miles out of that location and Tennessee, but we can also reach Atlanta from that location. And then our new north Florida location will be able to reach Atlanta and Miami with in two days

## Screencast of DMAIC and the Improve Stage

- DMAIC and the Improve Stage. So here we're back to our map of our logistics network with our ten customer destinations and our three warehouses. In the previous stage, we recognized that we needed two additional warehouses to be able to service all of our ten customer locations within two driving days. Therefore, we came up with two additional locations, one in Redlands, California and the other one in Lakeland, Florida which are going to serve as our new distribution centers. So in this stage, we're going to improve our logistics network by actually taking these addresses and placing them on the map. So here we have the California one. We're going to add it to the map.
- And then what I'm going to do is, I'm going to throw them here. I'm going to make it, look like a warehouse. Okay. So here we see our fourth warehouse, just outside of Los Angeles. And it will be able to reach, Destinations such as, San Francisco. Or Phoenix, in about 300 miles. In addition actually, if you look, Las Vegas is only 200 miles away, so we have most of the southern part of the West Coast, which is a large population center, that we can service out of this one warehouse.
- Now let's take a look at our Miami problem and there we picked the Lakeland, Florida distribution center. And I'll do the same thing. Type in the address. There we are. And incidentally, Google knows there is an Amazon distribution center here already. Okay. So we've added it here.
- Let's just make it look like a warehouse. And there we have it. Now what we can beautifully see here is that not only can we reach most of Florida fairly easily. Miami is somewhere around 200 miles away. Orlando, less than 60 miles. Tampa, 30, 40 miles. Jacksonville, 160 miles.
- Atlanta, less than 500 miles, as we hoped. As well as some of the South Carolina destinations and even into Southern Alabama. There's only one thing to do at this point. I would just, like to rename this Warehouse 4. And this we are going to call Warehouse 5. And that's it. This is our new and improved distribution and logistics network, consisting of five warehouses, servicing ten distinct customer locations.
