## Facilities: How many and where?

- Facilities, how many and where? When you build your logistics network you have to determine how many facilities do need, such as warehouses, terminals and so on. And where to locate them, that is a very important decision. And how to pick the right locations is really an art form, because you don't know what your needs are going to be in the future. Nevertheless good planning pays off, so when we look at our logistics network we have to make the decision. Do we have one warehouse, two, three, four, or several dozens like some big companies do? When you have fewer warehouses the advantages are that you locate your inventory in fewer locations, you pool your risk, and therefore are able to hold less inventory.
- When you have many facilities, you will carry more inventory, but your access to your customer is going to be much quicker, so the decision is a tradeoff. Do you want to save money building facilities and holding inventory, or do you want quicker access to your customers? I mentioned risk. The thing about inventory is that if it is in fewer locations, you need less of it, and that has to do with a safety stock. Because you can spread your safety stock over a larger area. The risk of stocking out is less with fewer locations. If you have more locations, each location needs their own safety stock, thus we have more safety stock overall in the system.
- After you determine how many warehouses to build you have to determine where to locate them. And you typically follow a center of gravity approach that puts you as close to the customer as possible. But you also have to consider that you do not stock every item in every warehouse, because some items may be needed In certain locales. Such as, in the north we need more winter coats than we do in the desert. Another interesting way to think about it is that you can use your transportation network as a storage device. For example, carmakers sometimes put several weeks worth of inventory Into trains and rail yards before they get to the dealers. That gives them a storage option even though it is transportation, per se.

## The Square Root Law

The Square Root Law 
It is nice rule of thumb for  estimating the changes in overall inventory as a result of changing the  number of warehouses. These calculations are assuming that nothing else  changes.

X2 = (X1) * √ (n2/n1)

n1 = number of existing warehouses n2 = number of future warehouses X1 = existing inventory X2 = future inventory

Examples:
Example 1:

Current inventory is 10,000 units

2 facilities become to 3

Estimated future inventory = (10,000) * √ (3/2) = 10,000 * 1.225 = 12,500 units.

Example 2:

Current inventory = 20,000 units

1 facility becomes to 4 facilities

Estimated future inventory = (20,000) * √ (4/1) = 20,000 * 2 = 40,000 units.

## Factors Influencing Logistics Networks

- Factors influencing logistics networks. When you build your logistics network, you trade-off two important factors. The one is cost, the other one is service. If we want better service to our customers, we probably have to spend more money. But logistics networks are already expensive, so most companies try to reduce those costs as much as possible while still maintaining a high-level of service. The cheapest logistics network looks different from the most expensive one. Nevertheless, the concept of cost versus service always applies and you can have a logistics network with only one warehouse and overnight transportation, which will give you great service, but it will be very expensive.
- Or you can be like Amazon and have top customer service, two-hour deliveries in some cases, but you need over 100 warehouses for that. Nevertheless, you have to pick the network that minimizes cost and gives you the best service possible. We're in the middle of Amish country and Urban Outfitter, a major clothing retailer based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania decided to build their warehouse right here. The reason why this location was, [NOISE] and there goes a UPS truck. The reason why Urban Outfitters chose this location, probably has to do with the proximity to their home office, their commitment to the local area and the ability to distribute up and down the eastern seaboard right from here in Lancaster county. It also behooved them that land was much cheaper here than in other locations and they were able to bring jobs to an economically distressed area. Two major drivers affecting logistics network are the cost of money, interest rates and the cost of fuel driven by the cost of crude oil.
- The way the impact logistics network is as follows. When interest rates are high, the cost of holding inventory goes up, because most of the money spent holding inventory is cash tied up that you could use otherwise. When fuel costs are going up, remember, fuel costs are the single largest expense of most transportation, the overall cost of transportation goes up. So when transportation is expensive, you want to have less of it. Therefore, you need more warehouses. When you have to spend a lot of money holding inventory, you want fewer warehouses. So as you see those two economic drivers that most companies do not have any control over, impact how their logistics networks should look.
- And it is important to anticipate where does factors are going to be in the future, so your network Is as up to date as possible. Nevertheless, you can make small adjustments by using rented warehouses and evolve it over time to make sure that your cost is as low as possible while delivering the best service possible.

## Striving for Logistics Customer Service

- Striving for the best logistics customer service. The goal of your logistics network is to make sure your customers are happy, and you keep them happy by keeping your promises to them. So for example, if you tell your customer you will buy a product from me and two days later, it will be at your door step, you should make it happen. Now, the way to make it happen is to make sure you have built the logistics network that can accomplish that and that is not by accident. In order to provide your customers with that top logistics customer service, you can have no stock-outs and you should have the lead time that you advertise, two concepts I will discuss next. Lead time is one of the most metrics and logistics, it's measured from the time of order submission to the time of order receipt. And we want it to be short, as short as possible but we also do not want it to vary at all because we cannot plan for variability.
- An example of that would be if you're shipping parts to a car manufacturer and that line is moving, if your part is delayed and they cannot build their cars, the cost of waiting for a part is astronomical. So you want to avoid any delays in your lead times as much as possible. An equally important metric is fill rate, which is defined as the percentage or orders that is shipped from inventory. Lead time will be affected by the fill rate because if you don't have the item in inventory, you will not be able to meet your aggressive lead time. Therefore we need to maintain enough inventory to ensure our fill rate is as high as possible and we don't have any stock-outs. Ultimately, the overall goal of logistics is to deliver the right product, at the right price, to the right customer, at the right place, at the right time, in the right quantity, in the right condition. Those are known as the seven Rs of logistics, companies are striving to achieve the seven Rs, but there's a wrinkle.

- Not every item that they sell is equally important. So, for example, we have different SKUs, known as stock keeping units, and some sell a lot, others sell a lot less. In general, for most companies, there are a few products that sell the most, also known as our A items. While we have B items and C items, and there are lots of them, they are not as critically important to our success because we don't make as much money on them. Our A items is where we need our best fill rate and our lowest lead time. And then, the other items, we can reduce cost while offering lower levels of service. And that is how most companies achieve low cost in logistics while maximizing their service levels when it matters.

## Logistics Networks Best Practices

#1 Use the fewest number of warehouses that are close to the largest number of customers
Since each warehouse adds cost you should be careful about the number of warehouses you have. Depending on how the network is set up, there are no good or bad numbers, but as the number of warehouses changes, other factors must adapt as well, such as which warehouse certain customers are serviced by changes, so does the amount of inventory held in each warehouse, and of course the transportation part of your network.

#2 Keep your miles-per-delivery (MPD) as low as possible
A good starting point is to look at each warehouse and calculate the MPD for all customers. Here are some good rules of thumb:

The farthest customer should not be more than 1,000 miles from the warehouse (if we assume that we seek a 2 day ground delivery).

The average MPD should be between 300 and 400 miles.

#3 Find a balance
It is most important that you pick the network that make sense for you. That means you will not overspend in any one area or make a critical mistake. Conservative approaches with careful considerations of the specific requirements will usually lead to the best results.
