# Warehousing Management

## Why do companies need warehouses?

- Why do companies need warehouses? So, let's talk about warehouses. We need warehouses in a variety of different situations. One of them is to consolidate our raw material supply. So, let's imagine a company that has two plants and three raw materials suppliers. Now we could shift from those raw material suppliers directly into both of our plans and it'll be fine, but there is a better way and that is to use a warehouse in between them that receives raw materials from the three suppliers and then ships out, assembled assortments as needed. Now, this has several advantages.

- Number one, efficiencies and we can create efficiencies in transportation, because we focus on each link specifically and make it really good. We can achieve efficiencies in inventory, because we can hold our inventory where it's needed and just as much as is needed. And then finally, in production, because our production facilities get the resupplies they need when they need them. The other advantages are risk pooling, we hold inventories just in one location rather than scattered across this network of companies. And then finally, our service level would be much hire than they would be otherwise. Even in more complex examples, warehouses still provide us with some benefits. Now, let's look at the case what we the same two plans and five different customers.
- You could shipped out from those two plans to the five customers individually, but the customer want an assortment of product produced by both plans. So you instead should use three warehouses to consolidate your output from the two plans, create assortment and then ship them out to your five final customers. This has the same advantages that we had before. It's more efficient. It reduces the risk and it provides the customer with better service. Now, let's review the three basic functions of warehousing. One is movement.

<img width="1919" height="803" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3655622-7517-4da0-9474-56765223133f" />

- Warehouses are meant to facilitate movement of products by receiving them, by transferring them across the warehouse, by picking them when their need and by facilitating shipment. The second one is storage. You want to have an assortment of products in you warehouse available readily for when the customers want them. Now, that storage may be in shorter term or longer term in the case of less used items. And finally, information. Information about your inventory. When it's coming in?
- What you currently have? When it's going to go out? There's different types of warehouses. To the left, we see a private warehouse, which a company built just for their products. They own it. They run it and it only serves their business. To the right, we see a public warehouse where there are products for multiple companies and the shipping process is managed by a specialty warehousing company, sometimes also known as a third party logistics company.
- They manage the warehousing and sometimes even the transportation process for their customer, the different shippers. You've seen what's outside of a warehouse, now let's take a look inside. Now in order to understand what goes into a warehouse, we have to just review really quickly what makes a warehouse really good? And those are three things. Number one, its speed. Once the product is demanded by the customer, we want to be able to ship it out as quickly as possible. Number two, quality.
- We don't want to send our customer the wrong item, because that would really make them angry. And third, productivity. We want to recycle as much as possible, think about the environment. We want to reduce as much as possible and we want to reuse, as much as possible. Inside the warehouse, there are several things going on. We will move around products using forklifts, dollies and carts and we're going to use them to unload our trucks. We're going to used them to move products around the warehouse.
- And then finally, we're going to used them to load our trucks backup and ship the product out. Warehouses are full of racks and shelves, because that's where we store the products in. Conveyors and sorters are where gets really exciting, that's what we used to move the products about in the warehouse. Right before we get ready to ship out the product, we're going to assemble and package the orders.

## How should we design a warehouse?

- How should we design a warehouse? This warehouse is massive, 1.5 million square feet and they have tons inventory for multiple brands in this location, but what makes a warehouse great is three things. The first of all is speed, you're able to ship out as much product as possible. The next one is redundancy, you have multiple checks built into your distribution system to ensure that the product that the customer asked for is actually the one that you deliver. And finally, productivity. Even though this is a massive warehouse, they're able to push out as much product as possible out of this huge distribution center. When it comes to designing our warehouse, we have to consider our goals.
- Speed, quality and productivity. Now we accomplish them by implementing a warehouse that has number one, the shortest distances possible and that is for all the products. But more importantly, the items that are selling the best must be located as close as possible to the shipping dock. Second, we want to maintain our quality. We don't want to ship out the wrong items, so we have to have redundancy built into the process. And then finally, we have to maintain as much throughput in our warehouse as possible by pushing out the items as quickly as possible. We start with unloading the product off of our trucks, then we take the product.

<img width="1919" height="775" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6698f49a-1143-49eb-b890-57c73c9fbdff" />

- Put it away into our storage location, then it's going to sit in storage until the customer is asking for the item and then we'll have a worker take it off the shelf. Put it on a conveyor belt. Moving to a sorting location where finally, the whole order, probably consisting of multiple products is going to be assembled into a package. We're going to take all those packages. Move them to the staging location in front of the dark door where we then load our truck. This whole process is controlled by a warehouse management system, which is essentially a very big computer program that times all of these different steps. This was the flow process.

<img width="1919" height="981" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78929603-4b23-4867-9761-4e7c8ac38684" />

- Now, let's visualize it in space. See the conveyor belt right going through the middle of the building? That then moves into the sorting area and the packaging area, and they pull from three different storage areas arranged by the importance of the items. Most important items, shortest distances and then we assemble the orders, close the dock doors and move them out.

## Warehousing Best Practices

Here are a number of best practices for setting up a warehouse.
S🧭 1. Strategic Layout Design
Adopt a “through-flow” design: Arrange receiving and shipping docks on opposite sides of the warehouse to minimize cross-traffic and streamline product movement.

Plan for flexibility and growth: Use modular racking and movable equipment that can adapt to changes in product mix, SKU count, and demand surges.Leave 20–30% space for future capacity expansion.

Maximize vertical space: Take advantage of every inch from floor to ceiling with pallet racking and mezzanines.Properly designed vertical storage improves safety and increases cubic utilization.

Optimize rack orientation: Run racks along the long side of the building to improve space utilization and traffic flow.

Enhance staging areas: Provide ample inbound and outbound staging space to prevent bottlenecks. Even if it reduces storage space, it often yields a net efficiency gain.

⚙️ 2. Streamline the Picking Process
Prioritize item placement by frequency: Store the most frequently picked items closest to the shipping area. Reassess regularly using sales and order data to ensure this remains accurate.

Optimize pick ergonomics: Place high-demand items within easy reach — floor level for pallets, waist-to-shoulder height for bins.

Reduce travel and retrieval difficulty: Shorten pick paths and minimize backtracking by sequencing orders by location.

Implement slotting optimization: Regularly re-slot SKUs based on velocity, size, weight, and affinity (items often ordered together).

Use batch and zone picking: Combine orders with similar pick paths and balance workloads across zones to improve throughput.

Consider cross-docking for fast movers: For high-turnover products, move items directly from receiving to shipping to eliminate unnecessary storage.

🚛 3. Efficient Dock Management
Treat docks as critical space: Every product flows through the dock, and space is limited. Design receiving and shipping docks to support high-frequency, varied receipts.

Separate inbound and outbound docks: Two docking areas on opposite sides prevent congestion and allow dedicated workflows for receiving and shipping.

Extend inbound staging across all dock doors: This maximizes flexibility and prevents dock door idle time.

Optimize traffic flow around docks: Keep drive paths clear and mark lanes for trucks, forklifts, and pedestrians.

🤖 4. Automation and Technology
Add automation wisely: Use forklifts, conveyors, sorters, and automated packing stations to increase speed and accuracy — but balance automation cost with flexibility needs.

Implement a Warehouse Management System (WMS):

Organize workflow and sequence orders by optimal pick paths.

Batch pick single lines, same-zone orders, and difficult picks.

Provide workers with handheld RF devices for real-time instructions.

Pick-to-light systems: Operators scan a barcode; lights indicate pick location and quantity — ideal for top 5–20% of products.

Voice-picking systems: Headsets deliver pick instructions, freeing workers’ hands and eyes. Often complements pick-to-light systems.

Adopt real-time tracking (RFID/RTLS): Locate pallets, equipment, and staff efficiently, reducing search time and loss.

Explore digital twins and analytics: Use simulations and WMS heatmaps to test layout changes and identify congestion zones before implementing physical modifications.

🧑🏭 5. Labor, Ergonomics, and Safety
Design for ergonomic efficiency: Reduce bending, reaching, and lifting heavy items. Keep high-velocity picks within natural reach zones.

Separate forklift and pedestrian traffic: Use visual markings, lighting, and barriers to prevent accidents.

Maintain safety zones around automation: Install guardrails and motion sensors near conveyors and robotic areas.

Provide regular safety and equipment training: Consistent practices across shifts ensure predictable workflows and prevent accidents.

🌿 6. Sustainability and Energy Efficiency
Optimize layout for minimal travel: Shorter routes mean less forklift fuel and reduced emissions.

Use energy-efficient lighting: Install LED lights and motion sensors to reduce energy use.

Incorporate natural lighting and ventilation: Skylights and fans improve working conditions and lower costs.

Centralize recyclable waste areas: Place near outbound docks for easy access and improved sorting.

🔁 7. Continuous Improvement and Maintenance
Adopt lean and Kaizen principles: Continuously eliminate waste, reduce motion, and improve flow.

Standardize operating procedures: Ensure consistency between shifts and teams to maintain efficiency.

Regularly audit warehouse performance: Review key metrics like pick rate, dock utilization, and order accuracy. Inspect racks, floors, and dock equipment for damage or inefficiency.

✅ Summary of Key Improvements Over a Traditional Layout
Two dock areas (inbound and outbound) to reduce congestion.

Expanded staging areas for smoother product flow.

Racks aligned along the long side of the building for better space utilization.

Increased space for fast movers to reduce travel time.

More accessible and extended conveyor belts.

Consolidated miscellaneous areas to maintain flow.

Opportunity to further improve conveyor access and inbound staging area coverage.

 Examples:
In the lecture, I have shown you a traditional warehouse layout. We are  going to improve on it a little by changing some features around. As a  reminder, here is the traditional layout:

<img width="1004" height="567" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d73e0dbb-ade7-431e-ac65-66534179efc4" />

<img width="1089" height="499" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95306940-0016-4aae-bc25-9098112e93dc" />

The most significant improvements over the traditional layout:
Notice how we have two docking areas, one on each side of the building. This enables us to focus on each task in the best way possible - without impeding on each other. We also gain two staging areas which improves the flow into and out of the warehouse. We do give up some storage space, but in this case it is a good trade-off to make since the staging areas are typical bottleneck spots that hinder the efficient movement of products into and out of the warehouse.

We also turned the racks so they run along the long side of the building. This approach usually improves space utilization.

We increased the space provided to the case lot/ fast movers compared to the other storage areas. Since most of our time is spent on fast movers, it is more efficient to allot them more space.

The conveyor belt system is more elaborate, but we have extended it for easier access from the end of each isle.

The miscellaneous areas are combined and moved to one side of the building as to not impede on the flow within the warehouse.

Can we improve this even further? Here are some ideas:
Access into the case lot / fast movers area is impeded by the conveyor belt.

The conveyor belt should have access to the end of each isle.

The inbound staging area does not extend over the entire row of dock doors.

# Inventory Management

## How much inventory do we need?

- How much inventory do we need? In this lecture, we're going to talk about inventory and inventory is typically made up of two different pieces. One is Cycle Stock, the other one is Safety Stock. Now, Cycle Stock has to do with the inventory that goes up and down during regular sales and replenishment. Safety Stock, we hold it just in case something we did not anticipate happens. So we don't really expect it to be used, but it's there if we need it. It's like an insurance policy.

<img width="1919" height="888" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ac1eb58-528c-4bed-ba69-9f141fe9f94c" />

- Let's look at an example. We are going to assume that we have a little company that sells 20 units per day and every time they get a shipment, they get 200 units and that's what we call cycle stock. So this cycles up and down, as we get our replenishment. And because we get 200 at day 1, we have zero at day 10, the average inventory that we have to hold is 100 units. The future is not always certain, that's why we cannot rely on stock alone and we need something called Safety Stock. Now, uncertainty can come in two forms. One, our demand is not what we expected it to be.
- Two, our replenishment may not arrive when we want it to arrive. And for those reasons, we need to hold Safety Stock. One of the things that can happen is that demand is not always what we think it is. Let's assume our products are flying off the shelf rather than selling 20 units worth of product everyday, we sell 25. What does that mean in detail? We still get our 200 units every 10 days. We also are selling 25 units per day.

<img width="1843" height="845" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40f1afb8-6960-4b6b-97d9-2bc5f6d013ba" />

- That means after eight days, we have nothing left. For that reason, we hold Safety Stock and how much Safety Stock do we need? 25 units per day over 2 days means 50 units worth of Safety Stock. Another case, the replenishment does not arrive when we expected to arrive. So, let's look at that. We got our 200 units worth of inventory. We expect it to last for 10 days, but the shipment does not arrive on day 10, it arrives on day 12.

<img width="1919" height="925" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e5ca532-7797-4935-9558-29ad585e4e4a" />

- So, what does that mean in terms of Safety Stock? We need to bridge two days with inventory. We sell 20 units a day. We need 40 units of Safety Stock and that is why our inventory is much higher than before. Now let’s put both cases together, this is where stuff really goes crazy. We sell 25 units per day and our replenishment arrived late, that means 4 days without inventory and we need to hold safety stock to bridge those 4 days with 25 per day. That means we need 100 units worth of Safety Stock.

<img width="1919" height="910" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/494c5aee-d594-4e34-abaf-6dfc6bcd3b5d" />

- See our average inventory just went up from 100 before without any uncertainty to 200. An inventory's pretty expensive.

## When to order inventory?

- When to order inventory? In the previous lecture we assumed that we'll just order 200 units worth of inventory. Now in practice, it's not quite as simple. Most companies are scrutinizing that decision very heavily and there are numerous, really thousands, of approaches of how you can determine how much inventory to order each time. I will review two methods the s.Q method and the s.S method. Open up any inventory textbook and you'll see those two popular methods. The s.Q system and the s.S system.
- Now, the little s stands for reorder point, in other words when are you going to trigger an order? The second letter, the Q stands for a fixed quantity that is determined ahead of time, and the S stands for a variable quantity that depends on the current inventory level as you place the order. The s.Q system is a continuous review method, where we monitor our inventory at all times, and then once we hit the reorder point, we place an order of the same quantity. In the s.S system, it's also a continuous review system, however, when we place an order, we are going to place it dependent on where we are currently in the inventory. So if we have a lower inventory, the order will be larger, because we order up to a certain level. So the order will be the difference between our current inventory and where we would like to be. Now let's review advantages and disadvantages of both.

<img width="1919" height="943" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cd916d8-3774-4ff8-8501-dea5a22887a2" />

<img width="1919" height="924" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a78bc2e4-9cd2-426c-841e-5bc3c4eb9928" />

- Advantages of the s.Q system, is that it's simple, it's very predictable for our supplier. However, in certain cases, it may not be as precise and proficient. The s.S method, may make it harder for a supplier, but it is a very precise system of inventory. No matter if you're selling strawberries, flowers, microchips, cars, or cats, inventory is a critical piece of your business. Knowing when to order inventory, knowing how much to order, is a critically important decision for your business. No matter which method you choose, either way you have to pick the right method in your situation.
