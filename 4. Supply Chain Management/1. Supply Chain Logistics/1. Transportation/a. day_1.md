## The Importance of Logistics.

- You buy Italian loafers that were made in Milan, two days later they get delivered to your front door. You order red snapper for dinner, it was caught this morning a 1,000 miles away, supply chain logistics makes all of this happen. It makes it affordable for consumers, profitable for companies in a global economy. I'm Rudy Leuschner with Rutgers Business School, and I'm excited to teach you about logistics. Logistics! [LAUGH] I'm actually a Professor of Supply Chain Management, and we're talking about logistics, so what are you doing here? Every modern company, from Apple to Zappos, lives, thrives, or dies by their ability to match supply with demand. 
- If you're considering a career in supply chain management, are already working in the field, are simply fascinated by how goods move around the globe, this course is for you. Here we see a truck carrying several cars. >> Sorry I'm not in. >> Aw, man. [LAUGH]

## Is this course for me?

Dear learner,
thank you for taking the time to look at this course. Please take a look at the following to understand what you are going to be able to do after completing this course, who this course was designed for and to ensure you are getting the most out of this course.

Why Supply Chain Logistics?
Logistics is defined as the movement and storage of goods, services, and related information. Therefore, the study of logistics is essential in today's global interconnected supply chains, where we can bring companies together through transportation, warehousing, and inventory management.

An Introduction to Logistics
In this introductory Supply Chain  Logistics course, I will take you on a journey to this fascinating  backbone of global trade. Please note that the idea for this course is to introduce learners to logistics. While I am planning to cover the most important pieces, this is not meant to be exhaustive nor should you expect to be an expert upon completion. But my goal is to show the major pieces of logistics in a fun manner and hopefully this will encourage you to learn more.

What topics will you cover?
We cover the three major building blocks of  logistics networks:

Transportation

Warehousing

Inventory

What will I be able to do upon completing this course?
After  completing this course, you will be able to differentiate the advantages  and disadvantages of different modes of transportation. 

You will  understand what goes into designing and setting up a warehousing  facility. 

You will be able to select the options that enable  you to develop logistics networks, that minimize costs and deliver top  customer service. 

Who is this course for?
This introductory course is designed for three general audiences. While this is not an exhaustive list, you should be able to see yourself in one of these three groups: 

Those of you who are exploring a career in Supply Chain Management, but lack the any background. This course will provide you with a general overview of the field of logistics.

Those of you who are working with people in logistics and want to understand their daily challenges better. 

Those of you who are fascinated by how the products, services, and information are moved and stored in a complex global logistics network.

What do I need to start?
This is an introductory course designed to provide you  with a start on your learning journey in logistics. We are going to cover logistics from a US perspective (this is where I live). As such, you do not need to  have any background in logistics, but it would be beneficial if you had a  basic understanding of: 


General business concepts

No math necessary!

## Moving Freight over the Road 

- Freight means (goods transported in bulk by truck, train, ship, or aircraft.)
- Moving Freight on the Road. About a third of all strawberries in the United States come from one area, Watsonville, California. When you think about it, it's really far away from New Jersey, over 3000 miles. Yet, when I walk down to my local grocery store, and I look at the strawberries, what do I see? Yeah, Watsonville, it says Watsonville right here, and this is over 3,000 miles away from here. How do they get there? Well, a lot of it has to do with trucks, lots and lots of trucks.
- And strawberries have to be refrigerated so they'd better move fast. That is what we're going to talk about today. Motor freight and why it is so important. When we consider motor freight, it has several advantages. Speed, it's very fast. Reliability, trucks rarely break down, and if they do, it's only for a very short amount of time. Three, items do not get damaged very often.
- And fourth, trucks can pretty much get anywhere. There's a road, a truck can drive on it. And when we talk about the other modes of transportation, I want you to keep in mind these advantages that trucking has. Motor freight is also very efficient in a financial sense. Because the roadways are paid for by the government and ultimately the taxpayers, it's a subsidized industry. Most of the cost is in fuel, wages, maintenance, equipment, and user charges. Not all trucks are the same.
- We need city trucks, usually smaller vehicles that can make it inside of a congested city without a trailer. We load stuff in the back. Then we have line haul-vehicles, and they come in different sizes. The most common ones are 40 foot containers that are used often for international shipments and intermodal. The other one is 53 foot containers which are very popular in the United States and Canada. In addition, we have specialty vehicles, such as refrigerator, our strawberries have to come on those, livestock containers, automobile carriers, and tankers. When we use different trucks, we connect them with terminals.
- Terminals are taking products from one truck, sorting them, and then moving them out on a different truck. We're not storing the items in these terminals, even though often they look like warehouses. There are three types of terminals. We have pickup and delivery terminals where we go from a city truck to a line-hall vehicle. Then we have cross docks where we connect networks of transportation together. And finally, we have relay terminals, where we just switch out the cab and put a trailer on a new cab, so we have a fresh driver and we move away.

## Motor Carriers

- Motor carriers. Motor carriers are a huge industry in the United States and many other developed countries. In the US, about two-thirds of the freight is moved by truck, and there are over two million trucks on the road and over five million trailers. The majority of these companies are small businesses, sometimes owning just one truck. There are three basic forms of operation. The first one is truckload, or TL. And what that means is as a shipper, you rent out the whole truck whether you use it or not, and the truck goes from your origin to your destination directly.
- Another form is less than truckload, or LTL. In which you own a share of the truck for that shipment and you pay by weight. Now that truck will not necessarily go from origin to destination, it will go through a network of terminals. And lastly, there's parcel freight, which is smaller shipments even than LTL, and it is much faster usually but also much more expensive. Unfortunately, trucking is not a very profitable business because the major form of competition is over price, everybody can get into the business fairly easily. Prices have come down in recent years and there's just not that much money in it for people.

## Flying Freight

- Flying freight. This is the largest flower auction in the world. From here, flowers get sent all over the world. Once the flowers leave the flower auction in Amsterdam, they get here on a plane in less than 24 hours. So when I buy them at my local store, they're still fresh. There's several reasons why shippers are using air freight. The first and most important is speed.
- You can get it there as fast as possible. Number two is capacity. You are able to ship a wide variety of products by plane. And then, a third one is accessibility. You can get to pretty much any destination, even by air. It's expensive, but when speed outweighs cost, air transportation is the way to go. Like trucking, this is a very competitive industry.
- It is hard to turn a profit because the biggest expense is fuel and prices are tied to fuel costs. Therefore no matter how high fuel is you rarely turn a profit. Not all planes are the same and we need different planes for different purposes. We have large all cargo planes that are just used for freight. We have smaller, narrow body planes, and a lot of cargo actually gets moved on commercial airlines as bally cargo. Airports work similarly to motor freight terminals. Goods come in, usually on truck then get loaded onto the planes and fly out.
- When they arrive at their destination, they land at the airport, planes get unloaded, you typically use drayage carriers which are small motor freight carriers for short distances and then, they probably go on a truck, towards their final destination.

## Air Carriers

- Air carriers. In the complex network between shippers, airports, air carriers, and customers, there are three basic types of operation. There are all-cargo carriers where you get the whole plane and it flies from the origin to your destination. Then you can move cargo in the belly of commercial planes and use their network, or you can move cargo through commercial parcel carriers, which have their own planes and sometimes even their own airports. Weights in air transportation are a mystery to many. On paper it looks simple, you get quoted the weight. However, weight must also correspond to a certain density.
- So, for example, a 1 kilogram package must be no larger than 6000 cubic centimeters. If it is heavier, you pay for the higher weight, but it's a smaller package. If it is bigger, you pay for the volume corresponding to a certain weight. So it's weight, but only if that weight is also a certain volume. Air carriers compete amongst two major lines. One is amongst fuel, which is their largest expense. And the better companies can use hedging to protect themselves against future price increases, the higher of a profit they can turn.
- The other one is delays added on by security. Delays, and the better companies can use technology to streamline that process, the better they will compete.

Lecture Summary
Operations 
All-cargo airlines are operating similar to TL - you rent the entire plane.

Commercial airlines are able to carry smaller quantities as belly cargo - similar to LTL.

Parcel carriers are also using planes for small shipments - but they are often very expensive.

Rates
The rates in air transportation are often a mystery to many. While the rate is quoted by weight, the actual rate charged corresponds to that weight if the package has a certain density. This is also known as the 
volumetric density
. 

So what happens when it is not the 'right' density?

If it is less dense, then you get charged for the volume translated to the corresponding weight

If it is heavier then you pay for the actual weight

Competition
Fuel costs: who can best manage the largest expense and hedge against future price increases

Who can manage the delays put on by security concerns. Technology is starting to help alleviate these issues.
