## Supplier Segmentation

- Supplier segmentation. Automakers have literally thousands of suppliers. Steel to the engine parts to the leather for the interior, plastics, electronics, and so on. And they cannot have exactly the same high level relationship with each one. So they have to segment. They have to pick those key suppliers that are critical to their business and have long term highly integrated relationships with them. And then everybody else will be treated differently based on the limited resources that we have available.
- Here we are at a local Honda dealership. And Honda, like Toyota is known for maintaining very good and close relationships with a lot of their key suppliers. We have previously discussed the [INAUDIBLE] matrix as one way of segmenting and classifying suppliers in different areas. What I'm going to talk about now is a more general classification scheme. That can be more useful to different types of companies, different organizations, and different situations. Now the basic philosophy behind it is that we're going to look at the benefits that a supplier may provide. And the challenges that we may encounter in working with that supplier.
- And by considering both benefits and challenges. We're going to come up with tailored strategies that take advantage of the most beneficial supplier. While minimizing the risk in the most challenging suppliers. Benefits are areas where we can gain by working with a certain supplier. For example, we may be able to gain a cost advantage because this supplier's very efficient at providing that one input that we need. Another advantage is operational flexibility or efficiency. By working with a certain supplier who is very efficient at how they deliver the products to us.
- We may be able to optimize our internal operations. Next, we may gain a marketing advantage from working with a supplier. For a very long time, customers chose computers that had a sticker on the box, and that sticker said Intel Inside. Because consumers knew they were getting an Intel processor. Which was superior to any other chip that they could buy from other companies. And finally suppliers may be able to help us innovate. There are many examples where both suppliers and manufacturers have worked together to come up with new products.
- And often, for a manufacturer, it's very challenging to have access to innovation, but suppliers may be better at it. So we can take all of these benefits and put them in the plus column. Challenges are those areas that make it more difficult working with a certain supplier. There are two categories. One is risk. Working with a supplier, we put some faith into that one company to deliver what they said they would deliver. And there may be unforeseen events that may prevent the supplier from delivering to us, for example, catastrophic events.
- If the supplier's in a flood zone or an earthquake area, it may be possible that their deliveries may be disrupted. Or bankruptcy can occur and then they have to shut down. Because we are too dependent on them and they may be too dependent on us, that can lead to problems. The other area is complexity. Complexity just adds a lot of layers of administration and management. That are required to make the processes work with a certain supplier. Having suppliers that require more complexity or more management makes it difficult to achieve gains in performance.
- Regardless, we have to consider both the benefits and the complexities when structuring our relationships with the suppliers. And now, what we need to do is we need to score both the benefits and the challenges In working with our suppliers. And each supplier will receive a score on all of these areas. Now how do you do it? You take all the benefits and you weigh them depending on what is important to you. And you do the same thing with the challenges. And then you come up with composite scores in both the benefits area and the challenges area.
- And you can create several quadrants of high challenge/high benefit suppliers which require a lot of management. And you treat them very differently than the low benefit/low challenges suppliers, which are much less complex to manage.

## Single versus Multiple Sourcing

- Single versus Multiple Sourcing. Imagine you are a shoe manufacturer. How many suppliers of leather should you have? In many cases, it makes sense to have multiple suppliers for the same input. But in other situations, it may be wise to only have a single source. Often, companies wrestle with this very important decision. Should I have multiple sources, or does one supplier give me everything I'm looking for?
- Regardless, this is a very important decision that has to be made very deliberately. And you are weighing the risk of a disruption with the added complexity of managing multiple relationships. There are several reasons why you would want to only have one supplier for a given input, and that has to do with simplicity. It is much easier to manage just one relationship rather than having multiple suppliers that you have to manage. You also get their full attention. And that may be a benefit because, if a supplier has thousands of customers and you're one of those thousands, they will not have the time or the resources to really work with you very closely. And finally, you may just be able to get everything you could possibly need from that one source.
- Why go elsewhere? In addition to those, there are other good reasons. For example, lately in the United States, a lot of manufacturing companies have looked at diversity suppliers, women owned businesses or minority owned businesses, to source some of their inputs. In fact, companies that do business with the US government have to actively seek out diversity suppliers. And that is part of the ethical compliance part of procurement that I talked about earlier. And this not only helps the company be a good corporate citizen, but it also helps the communities in which these companies operate in. And as we know, small companies are the life blood of every economy.
- So we want to actively seek to work with them. There are some risks that we incur by using a single supplier. You don't have a backup plan. If something fails with that supplier, everything fails. You're basically putting all of your eggs in one basket. The other risk is that you may not really know whether you're getting a good deal because you don't have a way to compare. If you had two suppliers, you could compare supplier A versus supplier B.
- But if you only have a single source, that's all you know. And the third risk is that you control a lot of the business of a supplier that's a single source and they control a fair share of your business. And that may be a risky proposition, because you don't know what happens by putting all of your eggs in one basket with a single supplier. So you have to weigh the benefits and the risks against each other. Now when we're talking about multiple suppliers, there's several benefits as well. For example, we can compare. And we know that we can give more business to a supplier that gives us the better deal and take away some business from a supplier that may not be performing up to our expectation.
- In addition, we also are able to hedge our risks. Because if one supplier goes down, there's another one that we can bring up. And finally, the risk with multiple suppliers is that it becomes harder to manage them. That complexity eventually takes a toll, and we have to be very careful to send our resources to the right location. Because this can go out of hand, and we spend more resources managing these multiple suppliers than benefits that we get out of using those multiple suppliers. So the question of how many suppliers to use is a very important one. In most cases, the answer is multiple suppliers. But there also good reasons to use only a single source when appropriate.

## Don't Let Your Supply Chain Control Your Business

- While it is sometimes a good thing to be very closely integrated with your supply base, you can rely too much on them and as a consequence suffer. This article highlights a nicely nuanced view of close supplier relationships.  I would ask you to read the article and then discuss it in the next discussion prompt.
