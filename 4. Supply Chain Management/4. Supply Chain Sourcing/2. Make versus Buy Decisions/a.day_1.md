## The Make versus Buy Decision

- Make versus buy. Every year I wrestle with the same age-old question, do I bake a birthday cake for my daughter's birthday? Or do I just go out and buy one? This is a difficult question to answer because I would like to make her something that feels like I really gave her something from the heart and didn't just go out and buy one. But I can't really bake that well. And the birthday cakes we usually get her are amazing and they taste great. So I end up always buying one for her, but it's still a very difficult question for me.
- Now companies have to face the same decisions. Do they make everything that goes into their products or do they find a vendor that supplies them with that? It is an important decision from many aspects. One, what are the boundaries of our company? Where do our company operations start and where do they finish? The other one is, what do customers value? And third, what are we good at?
- So this decision needs to be made very carefully and very deliberately. It's not something you just decide on a whim. You have to have proper analysis in place. To help you whether to make or buy, I'm offering you a couple of questions that you should ask yourself in coming up with the right answer. The first one is what business are we in? What is our company about and what is core to our company? Everything that is core should stay in-house.
- Everything that we determine is not a core area should be outsourced. The second question is, are we good at making this one item? And if we're not good at it, we should not make it, because we can buy it from somebody who's much better than we are. For example, a lot of companies decide they are not very good at handling their own logistics. So they decide to pay another company to handle their logistics. Third, do we have a competitive advantage? If we decide something is core to our business, but we're worse than our competitors then it's the wrong thing to have as a core item.
- So we don't necessarily want to spend resources doing that. And lastly If we decide to put in resources into making a certain item, what happens to those resources? They're gone. But we could have used them better elsewhere. So we need to be very conscious of what resources we expend in making items or choosing to not expend those resources and buying the item. Harley Davidson continues to thrive, partly because their label is Made in the USA. Consumers like that, so the company continues to produce in-house in the United States.
- And that is what their consumers are looking to buy in terms of the motorcycles. Now when it comes to the accessories, which is another big part of Harley Davidson's business, they outsource those things to contract manufacturers. All the jackets, the t-shirts, the hats. People love them and they don't care if they're produced elsewhere. As long as the motorcycles are made in the USA, they're happy. So here's an example of a company that shows certain areas of their business to be core and kept in-house and even in the country where it was started rather than outsource, but other pieces can be outsourced. Apple relies heavily on contract manufacturers to build all of their products, from iPhone to iMac to MacBook.
- Nevertheless consumers are very loyal to the company even though they know somebody else actually builds the products. But it doesn't matter to them because they're well designed products, consumers love using them and they continue to go back and buy more products. So in Apple's example, they found their core business in marketing, research and development and providing an environment for all of these little devices to work together very well. It's a big task, but it does not include manufacturing products, which other companies can do better than Apple would. Now you can also outsource the wrong parts of your company. For example, the German beer maker Lowenbrau chose to have a licensing deal with Miller Brewing Company in the United States, one of the big brewers here in the USA to produce Lowenbrau beer, but they produced it in the United States. So it was domestic production for the domestic market, and it really failed because consumers when they bought Lowenbrau, they wanted real German beer.
- Not just the German recipe made in the US. And therefore, the Loöwenbrau brand in the United States took a big hit, and it really deteriorated the company much more than it would have if they continued to ship German beer to the United States, which initially they thought was not very profitable. I personally prefer Augustiner which is the real Munich beer, probably considered the top beer brewed in Munich. And it's in Bavaria, which is overall known as the best German beer. I might be a little bit biased. And the taste and the quality of this beer is better than any other beer that I've ever tasted. So if you want a real German beer this is what I would recommend.
- Now back to make versus buy. In many cases, companies can also choose both making and buying. You may choose to make a part of your product and if you need additional production, you will find a contract manufacturer to do it for you. So you can have the best of both worlds. Nevertheless, make versus buy is an important decision for any company.

## Why Should I Insource?

- Why should I insource? No company can survive if they don't have at least one area in which they are better than the competition. Now when we look at it from a portfolio of different tasks, we have to determine what should we do in house because we have an advantage. And if we do more things in house we create more value. That value is paid for by consumers. So if we create more value, we make more money. There also is the possibility that a process done in house will improve over time.
- So maybe in the beginning we're not very good at doing something, in house, but we become better. And potentially we can become very competitive compared to other companies. Nevertheless, there are risks and benefits of insourcing and they must be weighed against each other. Let's say that you have a non-essential task that typically you would outsource. So you are sending that work to a supplier who will charge you what it cost them to perform the task, plus a profit margin. Now if you did that work in house all the cost you would incur was your own cost. And your own cost might be less than what the supplier charges you while making a profit.
- You could negotiate a lower profit for the supplier, but they may say no. So you have to be very careful in how you look at these decisions. No matter what the company, everyone has the potential to take an in house process and make it better. For example, you can hire experts who know how such a process should be performed and they improve your process. They can be in house talent, or they can be consultants. Or you can just invest in that process, buy better technology and it becomes more efficient. And finally, if you are in a merger situations where two companies are coming together, you can take the best parts of each company and then improve your performance that way.
- But there are also two major risk categories that apply to insource processes. The first category is that the insource process may be much inferior to what an outsource process would have. For example, you may have higher cost, lower quality, less flexibility and worse service overall. The other major risk category is that administratively an insource process is very inefficient to manage. When it comes to an outsource process, it's a simple contract. If they don't perform as expected you always have the option to fire them and go somewhere else. If you have an insource process it is a lot harder to get that accomplished.
- So you have to weigh the benefits of the insource process against the risks that occur with it. And pick the processes that lend themselves to insourcing and also pick the processes that lend themselves to outsourcing.

## Why Should I Outsource?

- Why should I outsource? No company can be great at every single thing they need to do in order to sell a product. So rather than trying to do everything and not doing it well, we pick and choose those few areas we're good at. And then, everything else, we find specialists who are able to do it even better than we could. That way we ensure that we get access to the best processes possible, and even our competitors could not possibly get better access. And we're also trying to find the right suppliers in addition to the process, regardless there are benefits and risks to outsourcing. The number one benefit that outsourcing provides is access to world class resources.
- In other words, the company that we're outsourcing to is a specialist in that one area, that is all they do. For example, if we are not very good at logistics, we try to find a logistics service provider. They only specialize in logistics, so they're going to be very good at it. The other one is we also are going to be able to have access to economies of scale we wouldn't otherwise have, because this one company provides service to a wide range of customers. So they're able to create these economies of scale, and typically provide us with a much better cost that we would be able to do on our own. And lastly, outsourcing companies are able to access special resources that might be hard to access, such as low cost labor. Because they can put factories in areas where people will work for a lot cheaper, ultimately making our product less costly, and it becomes a benefit to our customers.
- This also provides a benefit to the world economy, because now different countries can focus on specific areas. Asia can focus on manufacturing, high tech items. India can focus on providing top-notch services in the IT industry, and other countries will just play to their strengths. Rather than everybody trying to do everything, we collaborate and each country, and even each company, will play to their strengths. This is an overall benefit to the world economy. There is also a lot of flexibility in outsourcing, because if a supplier is not performing up to the expectations that they have set we're able to incentivize them to bring up their performance. After all, it is a legally binding contract and if they do not live up to those expectations we are able to go out and find someone else. 
- This is a lot harder if you're dealing with an internal department. In addition, the flexibility in terms of volume as we have for example, seasonal demand, is unsurpassed with a service provider because they can leverage multiple customers, and multiple demand patterns that customers may have. They are able to react much more quickly to changes in demand than a single company with internal operations would be able to. Outsourcing might not be all that cost efficient once you factor in all of the other costs that go with outsourcing a process. You have to consider the total cost of ownership when outsourcing, and this not only includes the cost of the product itself, but also logistics cost which are made up of transportation, warehousing, and inventory cost. Administrative costs, in other words, the cost of managing the whole process that is now performed by an outside company. Quality costs, the cost of complexity, because your organization just became a lot harder to manage.
- And then finally, we have to figure out how these arrangements are set and make sure that all of these costs are factored into the price. Some of these other things could be operating in a war zone, or in an area that used to be stable and now becomes a war zone. Or using conflict minerals, such as Nintendo, who got caught using conflict minerals in their products but in fact it was one of their suppliers that changed sources to a conflict mineral source. Nevertheless, these factors can have huge financial and reputational implication on the company itself.

## The Outsourcing Dilemma

With the recent political developments, the topic of outsourcing was in the news a lot.  As with any topic, there are at least two sides to the argument.  While my goal is not to take a side here, I believe it is critical to be familiar and understand as much of this debate. With that in mind, there are several stakeholders, each with slightly different objectives. To help you think about this, I would like to point out some of the objectives that might drive behaviors in this decision. 

Company Leadership
Must act in the interest of the company's owners (in the case of publicly traded companies, this is the investors), in shot their job is to:

Maintain and increase profitability (increase revenue and reduce costs)

Maintain competitiveness in the marketplace (against other companies offering similar products and services)

Reduce risk

Implement the vision and mission of the company

Affected Employees
Maintain their employment:

Keep their jobs secure

Resist any outsourcing

Not-affected Employees
Maintain their employment:

Keep their jobs secure

If necessary, restrict Outsourcing to other parts of the company if necessary

Investors
Invest in a company for profit and thus want to ensure:

Their investment is paying a return that is sizable and secure

The company remains competitive.

The Public at Large
is interested in a healthy and vibrant local community.

Of course, these are not all of the different viewpoints. Now it is your turn to add to the above objectives!
