## Sourcing Best Practices

- Sourcing best practices. There’s several things to consider when setting up a sourcing strategy in a company. One is how do we pick the best suppliers? And that has to do with supplier evaluation. We need to setup guidelines of what we would like in a supplier, and then actively go out and search for potential suppliers, evaluate them and then keep the ones that meet our requirements, while rejecting the ones that don't meet our requirements. Another part of this is score carding, and score carding is a continuously updated file, usually it's done electronically, where we track the supplier against specific metrics that have been agreed upon at the beginning of this relationship. So for example, we agreed on certain lead times, certain quality matrix, certain prices or even cost reductions that are to be achieved over time.
- And we're always providing our suppliers feedback on these different categories. So they know where they stand and we know how well they're doing against our expectations. Continuous monitoring of supplier performance and keeping just suppliers that meet our requirements are two central tenants of sourcing strategy, and I would call them best practices. The majority of fashion items are produced by contract manufacturers and so are electronics. The way you manage your organization using contract manufacturers is slightly different than if you had your own in house manufacturing. Because you're relying very heavily on these other companies to produce your goods, you have to be very good in designing new products, marketing new products and overall management of the whole process from beginning to end. Contract manufacturers are essential in certain industry, and you cannot get by without them, but they're shunned by others.
- For example, the auto industry definitely wants to keep manufacturing in house. So how do we manage contract manufacturing? Well, it is typically a long term arrangement to manufacture items for us from beginning to end. Because we don't necessarily have our in house manufacturing, we rely on these contract firms for everything from sourcing all the way through logistics. Now finally, let's take a look at the product that you're using. How did it get built? In other words, what does Coursera do and how does the company operate?
- So Coursera provides a platform for you to be able to learn. And they do it with content sourced from multiple universities. So as I was building this course, I was asked by Coursera whether I would like to be a supplier of content. Therefore, I agreed, and the result is this course. What Coursera did on their own was marketing this course. They also provided the platform on which you are learning. So Coursera serves two functions.
- One is marketing, and the other one is distributing the content. And providing the conduit in which that content gets delivered to you, the learners. So I think Coursera created a win, win, win situation. I win because I can share my content with you. Coursera wins because they are a successful business. And you win because you are able to receive content from multiple sources in a unified, streamlined and polished manner.

## Procure-to-Pay Systems

- Procure-to-pay systems. In the quest of gaining additional efficiency in the procurement department, a lot of companies have looked at IT solution to improve their efficiency. So called procure-to-pay systems have made the job of a buyer a lot easier. And they do it by automating certain steps that previously had been done by hand. The way procured-to-pay systems work is that they provide the backbone of the whole purchasing process. From finding a supplier and finding the right item, by providing a catalog, to sending out a purchase order, to confirming the receipt of the goods, to paying an invoice. All of these steps are done electronically, they're done seamlessly, and they integrate with a systems of theses suppliers, and sometimes even with customers.
- So we are using our customers procure-to-pay system and they are gaining efficiencies by working with us as well. There are certain benefits to using procure-to-pay system. By automating certain parts of the purchasing process, we're able to get efficiency without human intervention. And they're also very transparent because all of the information is in one system. In addition, we can integrate into our inventory management system, our warehousing system, and even trigger orders automatically and have our suppliers fulfill them seamlessly. So we don't need to think when we need to buy additional wood for our pizza oven. Our pizza oven will always have wood because as soon as we're running low, we are sending for additional wood.
- A special feature that is built into some of these procure-to-pay systems is called reverse auctions. The way a reverse auction works is we have a specific item that we're looking for. And we have put forward the exact specifications, quality level, everything that a supplier would need to know about the item we're looking to purchase. And we're sending that information to all our suppliers that could possibly be interested in supplying us with the item. Now, what they do on their end is they log onto the system at a specific time, and they're putting in the price that they're able to charge for supplying us with that item. And we see all of the different prices that suppliers offer and sometimes we could even let them played out through multiple rounds where they can bid against each other. Unlike a traditional auction where the price goes up, in a reverse auction the price keeps going down and down, which is better for us, the buyer.
- Now you can only used reverse auctions well in specific situations when the product is very precisely defined. If it's vague or if they're multiple ways of achieving the outcome that we desire, I don't think it's a good idea to use reverse auctions. It's a great tool to quickly get to the best price for a very well defined item.
