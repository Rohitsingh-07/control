## What is Supply Chain Sourcing?

- [NOISE] Ever wonder why you can only buy Coke products at McDonald's [SOUND] and only Pepsi at KFC? [SOUND] Or why consumers are willing to pay a premium price for fair trade chocolate and coffee. Supply chain sourcing determines all of these realities. It enables manufacturers to build preferred relationships with vendors and procurement departments to monitor and insure regulatory, quality, ethical and safety compliance in a global economy. I'm Rudi Leuschner with Rutgers Business School and I'm excited to teach you about sourcing, holistic sourcing. Every company from the multinational Johnson and Johnson to my local Kimberton Whole Foods heavily relies on their ability to build and sustain mutually beneficial relationships with their supply base. With good relationships comes lower cost, higher quality, and more dependable supply.
- If you're considering a career in supply chain management, are already in the field, or are simply fascinated by how companies leverage their partnerships with their suppliers this course is for you. [MUSIC]

## Purchasing

- Purchasing. Purchasing is a task that all of us do in our daily lives, day in and day out. We don't even think about it. But for most businesses this is much more complicated. Take for example these boots. There's leather, there's stitching, theres rubber that needs to go on them. Those are direct materials.
- There's also indirect materials which are needed to make the whole manufacturing system run. And finally there are capital goods you need to purchase the land, you need to build the factory, and you need to buy machinery. So all of these different aspects of purchasing are required to run a company. A good purchasing process is hugely important for all of these categories. And purchasing, in general, makes up a huge part of companies' cost. For example, service companies spend up to 40% on purchasing, and manufacturers, this number balloons up to 70%. Nevertheless, a company must be able to manage costs and ensure continuity of their supply of raw materials.
- If they want to be successful. Purchasing generally refers to the activity of buying goods and services. And in order to have a streamlined process five different phases must be observed. It all starts in phase one with the purchase order. This lets the supplier know that we want the items from them. And they will initiate the sale on their part. The next activity is the advance shipping notice.
- We want to receive an advance shipping notice that helps as when the good day expected to be arrived. We going to monitored through out transit. In the third step we are confirming that we received the goods. In the fourth step, we're processing the invoice. And that then leads us to the fifth step, which means that we're paying the supplier and we're closing the purchasing loop. Generally, this type of process has to be implemented in the company to be as easy and quick as possible. So what is it that purchasing must accomplish?
- Well get ready, because I'm going to say the word right twelve times. You're looking to buy the right material, at the right quantity, at the right quality, from the right source, at the right price. Of course, these products have to be delivered and they have to be delivered at the right time, to the right location, with the right transportation mode, at the right level of service. And finally, all of this has to be managed with the right contract and the right length of payment terms.

## Procurement

- Procurement. In the previous lecture, we talked about the five tactical phases of purchasing, you process the purchase order, you receive and monitor the advanced shipping notice, you confirm there's a receipt of the goods, you process the invoice. And you pay the supplier. These five tasks are tactical activities that happen as part of the purchasing process. However, all of these is part of the broader procurement departments role. And not just these five tactical items. Now, procurement itself has to also go out and collaborate, not only with suppliers but also internally, with logistics around the movement and storage of items, with manufacturing about the building of products and be informed by planning and how we see the business moving forward.
- A procurement department's value add is that it centralizes all activities that revolve around suppliers. And it manages those relationships with suppliers proactively. Rather than different people throughout the organization going out and finding their own supplier, and talking to them, and buying from them, we have the purchasing department doing it in a centralized manner. And they're able to get the most out of those relationships, and create economies of scale when purchasing which not only helps the suppliers have a better view of sales, but it also helps the buying organization get a better price. Most organizations view the procurement department's role as managing cost. And as we heard before, they are a large part of the organization. However, when we talk about cost it doesn't just come down to negotiations.
- Sure, we're going to negotiate over price and settle the other service and quality issues, but price is not the ultimate goal. We can also achieve lower prices by for example offering volume commitments. So both sides are getting what they are looking for. The seller can sell more and the buyer buys each item for less. In addition to price, quality and service, there's also other issues such as risk. There's a lot of risk in the supplier not delivery and procurement has to be able to manage those risks. There are other aspects that are important to the procurement department's role.
- And one of these example is sustainability. No company can be truly sustainable if their inputs are not all so sustainable. For example, on the environmental side, they're companies such as Patagonia who pay a tremendous amount of attention to environmental issues in general. And they make sure that their supplier have the same high standards of protecting the environment as Patagonia does. In fact, when you buy one of their products you see right there on the web page. Where the product was produced, who produced it, and what type of materials they used. Another example is the social aspect.
- Since there have been so many stories where companies were using suppliers that had bad labor standards, that were treating people. And I could have believe or there are also companies that want to have a vibrant communities. So they are actively looking for diversity supplier, minority on businesses, women on businesses. And lastly, economic, because the economy is still one of the foundational three triple bottom line aspects. We want to have suppliers that are financially viable and that have. The ability to exist long into the future. So therefore, from a sustainable perspective we don't want to just negotiate hard with them over price.
- We want them to be able to make a good living. And thus, all of these aspects of sustainability become an important part of the procurement department mission. A procurement department has to take significant steps to ensure continuity of supply, so risk management is one of the foundational pieces that procurement has to pay very close attention to. There are three types of risks. One is the service levels have to not fluctuate very much. So you need to have processing in place that ensure that your suppliers deliver the service level that they promised. The next one is catastrophic events, and they could be national disasters, such as floods, and there was a big flood in Thailand a couple of years ago that completely destroyed factories in the electronics and technology industries.
- Of course, there was the Japanese tsunami which severely impacted the odd industry in Japan and also some high tech companies, so a company really needs to pay a lot of attention to how they are exposed to risk and properly mitigate that risk. And then, finally, you have to be able to protect yourself against a supplier going out of business, so you need to be able to monitor a suppliers health from a financial perspective, and be able to take corrective action before it impacts your business. While some of these risks can be managed by buying insurance. A lot of the other ones cannot be insured against. So you have to have management practices in place that protect you against those risks.

## Supply Management

- Supply Management. Once companies realized that purchasing and procurement are important topics for the success of the business, they started thinking of ways to make this whole management of suppliers much better and much more efficient. So supply management refers to a more strategic view of relationships with suppliers. And the idea behind it is that we are targeting and segmenting different categories of suppliers. And those different categories will receive different levels of attention from management. And the way we structure those relationships will be very differently depending on the category that a supplier goes into. Here is how you would put together a Kraljic matrix.
- First, you'd look at all your goods and services, and you classify them in terms of profit impact and supply risk. Then, you'd look at the supply market and you analyze it. Third, you then determine your strategic positioning within that broader framework of the supply market and the good and services you buy. And fourth, you develop action plans and strategies to best take advantage of your position relative to your suppliers. The Kraljic Matrix is built upon two different aspects. One is profit impact, the other one is supply risk. So as we put together the matrix visually, we have profit impact on the vertical and supply risk on the horizontal.
- So then, we have high and low categories. In the high profit impact and high supply risk category, we have our strategic suppliers. In the low profit impact, high supply risk category, we have our bottleneck suppliers. In the high profit impact, low supply risk category, we have our leverage supplier. And then finally, in the categories where both profit impact and supply risks are low, noncritical. In the strategic supplier category, where we have a high profit impact and a high supply risk impact, we are striving to focus on implementing great relationships with these suppliers. We truly want partnerships with them.
- So our goals are not going to be just to drive down cost. But we're truly seeking to create win, win situations in both our benefit and the benefit of our suppliers. We are also trying to strive for additional innovation. Suppliers may have innovation capabilities which they can leverage with us. And we're going to use them to both benefit and drive additional sales by coming up with brand new products. We are going to try to mitigate risk by implementing tighter integration, almost working as one company. And finally, the result of this is only very few suppliers are going to fit into that category.
- But they're very important to our business. We are very important to their business. So, all the resources that are required for this management are going to be able to be put up. Then, we have bottleneck suppliers. So those suppliers hold a high risk for us, but they don't have a very high impact on our profitability. The number one goal with them is to manage that risk and the way you manage that risk is to have multiple sources. You want to have diversity of supply because if one supplier may fail, you have other ones to step in at a moment's notice.
- You also want very tight control on service level. You want to know as much as possible about what's going on with that supplier so you can manage that risk. Because you cannot afford to risk a supply disruption. Then, there are leverage supplier. So, they have a high profit impact but low risk. Your goal will be to get as much cost out of buying products with these suppliers as possible. You don't worry about risk because that's not much of a concern.
- You focus in on obtaining the best price, best quality and best service. And you do that through the hardest negotiation that you can. You may also be able to offer a supplier higher volume in exchange for better prices. And finally, there are noncritical suppliers. Those are very small suppliers, we don't buy a lot from them and they don't really affect our business. So your overall goal with those suppliers has to be that you want to simplify the process as much as possible. You don't want to spend any time of money or resources on managing those suppliers.
- So you want to automate as much as possible. You want to streamline and you want to simplify. Because that complexity is going to really be able to hinder doing well in the other three categories that are much more important. So there are your four categories of suppliers within the Kraljic Matrix. And each one receives different attention and a very different buying process. So overall, the Kraljic Matrix is a customized and systematic approach to managing relationships with different groups of suppliers. And we're going to use this targeted approach to focus our resources where they really have an impact and we have different strategies depending on our needs.

## Strategic Sourcing

- Here we are at a Coca-Cola factory. McDonald's is a huge customer, so the whole factory is paying a lot of attention to any possible demands that McDonald's might have. Similarly for McDonald's, Coke is a big supplier. So anything that they can do to make the relationship better, they are going to work on. There are high benefits, because of the huge part of each other's business that they are, but also high risks. Because if there was a disruption, both companies would be severely damaged. The strategic supplier category is of the highest importance for an organization. 
- Those are the suppliers that can really make or break your business. So you have to pay special attention on how you manage those relationships. You can not really go in and try to reduce costs or get them to come down in price, because they will find ways to get back at you. So you have to truly establish long-term relationships that are in the best interest of both sides. And you have to focus on win-win situations rather than competitive situations, because the relationship is so important. And finally, you have to create value together. So the idea is that you come up with innovation through this partnership.
- So how do you create a win-win relationship? Well, you have to take each other's side and look at this supplier and buyer relationship from the other perspective. What is important to the other side, and what is important to me? And you have to find a way to achieve both of these objectives at the same time. So for example, if in my best interest would be to reduce my cost, and obviously my supplier would like to make more money, how do I solve that dilemma? Well, you could set it up this way. You could say I'm going to pay less per item, but I'm going to give you additional volume.
- So I'm going to buy more from you in exchange for a lower price. And possibly I could take that volume from other suppliers away and give it to this preferred supplier. So they get more volume, which is in their interest, and I get a lower per unit cost, which is in my interest. Nevertheless, you can not go into these types of discussions with strategic suppliers saying that if this doesn't happen, I am going to walk away. Strategic supply relationships are meant to be long-term. Co-creation of value refers to the mutual and collaborative interaction between a buyer and a seller. So the idea is that both sides collaborate and there is new value created together as part of that interaction.
- Now typically the way we look at value is that value in a traditional sense lies within the product. And the product carries value, and then the buyer pays the seller for that value. Now in a co-creation of value setting, value is in the service, and the product is just the vessel through which that value is being delivered. I'll give you a personal example. I could go on the Nike website and co-create my own shoe together with Nike. Nike has all the colors and all the designs ready for me, and all I need to do is click and point at the different parts of the shoe, and design them in a way that I like it. Now I get the benefit of designing my own shoe which holds value for me. And Nike gets to sell me a pair of shoes.
