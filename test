hi
Exactly — **yes**, that’s right in most cases.

### 🚫 If you **only push to a feature branch** (like `dev`, `experiment`, or `my-branch`) and **never merge it into `main` or `master`**, then:
- ✅ The commits still exist in the repo,
- ❌ But they **won’t show up on your GitHub contribution graph** (green squares),
- ❌ And **won’t count toward your activity overview**.

### ✅ What GitHub *does* count for contributions:

| Action                          | Counts as Activity? |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Commits to `main`/`master`      | ✅ Yes               |
| Commits to other branches       | ❌ No (unless merged)|
| Pull requests                   | ✅ Yes               |
| Issues created                  | ✅ Yes               |
| Commits to private repos        | ✅ Only if you enable the setting |
| Merging a PR to `main`          | ✅ Yes               |

### ✅ Fix: Make Sure to Merge or Push to Default Branch

You don’t *have* to work directly on `main`, but to make your contributions show up:

- **Create a PR** from your branch into `main`
- **Merge** the branch into `main`
- Once it’s merged and pushed, GitHub will recognize those commits as part of your contribution graph 🎉

### Bonus Tip 💡
If you’re working solo or testing, you can just commit directly to `main` in a test repo to make sure everything’s counting properly.
