## Classification with Multiple Outputs (Optional)

- We learned about multi-class classification, where the output label Y can be any one of two or potentially many more than two possible categories. There's a different type of classification problem called a multi-lable classification problem, which is where associate of each image, they could be multiple labels.
- This is an example of multi-label classification problems because associated with a single input, image X are three different labels corresponding to whether or not there are any cars, buses, or pedestrians in the image. In this case, the target of the Y is actually a vector of three numbers, and this is as distinct from multi-class classification, where for, say handwritten digit classification, Y was just a single number, even if that number could take on 10 different possible values.

- One way to go ahead and build this kind of neural network for multi-label classification is to just treat this as three completely separate machine learning problems. We could build one neural network to decide are there any cars? The second one to detect buses and the third one to detect pedestrians. That's actually not an unreasonable approach.
- But there's another way to do this, which is to train a single neural network to simultaneously detect all three of cars, buses, and pedestrians, which is, if your neural networ architecture, looks like this, there's input X. First hidden layer offers a_1, second hidden layer offers a_2, and then the final output layer, in this case, we'll have three output neurons and we'll output a_3, which is going to be a vector of three numbers.
- Because we are solving three binary classification problems, so is there a car? is there a bus? is there a pedestrian? We can use a sigmoid activation function for each of these three nodes in the output layer, and so a_3 in this case will be a_1^3, a_2^3 and a_3^3, corresponding to whether or not the learning algorithm thinks it is a car, and no bus, and no pedestrians in the image.

- Multi-class classification and multi-label classification are sometimes confused with each other.

> **Note**: Normally, in this course, the notebooks use the convention of starting counts with 0 and ending with N-1,  $\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}$, while lectures start with 1 and end with N,  $\sum_{i=1}^{N}$. This is because code will typically start iteration with 0 while in lecture, counting 1 to N leads to cleaner, more succinct equations. This notebook has more equations than is typical for a lab and thus  will break with the convention and will count 1 to N.
