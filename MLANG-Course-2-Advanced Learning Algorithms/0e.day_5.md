## Inference in Code

- Tensorflow is one of the leading frameworks to implementing deep learning algorithms. The other popular tool is Pytorch. One of the remarkable things about neural networks is the same algorithm can be applied to so many different applications
- We are going to take the coffee beans roasting algorithm. Can the learning algorithm help optimize the quality of the beans we get from a roasting process like this.
- While Roasting coffee beans, we can control two parameters. Temperature at which we'are heating as well as the duration
- In the diagram below, we see that the coffee we roasted is good or not. Cross here, the positive cross y equals 1 corresponds to good-tasting coffee, and all the circles correspond to bad coffee
- This shows that if the coffee is undercooked, overcooked or all the possibilities where the coffee could be bad tasting.

- There have actually been serious projects using Machine Learning to optimize the coffee roasting. The task is given a feature vector x with both temperature and duration, say 200 degrees Celsius for 17 minutes, how can we do inference in a neural network to get it to tell us whether or not this temperature and duration will result in a good coffee
