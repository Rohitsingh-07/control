- All of Human thought is from neurons sending electrical impulses and sometimes forming new connections of other neurons.

- The rise of deep learning algorithms is basicallly because it enhances the performance of a given process and with more data traditional mehtods of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are something which did not have that good of performance as compared to neural networks.

- This is also one of the reason why the rise of using GPUs have increased
