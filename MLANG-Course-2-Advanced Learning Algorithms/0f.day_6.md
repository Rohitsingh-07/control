## How Neural Networks are implemented efficiently

- The reason why neurlal networks have been able to scale up is because neural networks can be vectorized. They can be implemented very efficiently using matrix multiplications.
- In the code that we saw in the last lecture, the one where we are taking the input, the weights of the 3 neurons and the parameters and implementing forward propagation on a single layer
- We can develop a vecorized implementation of this code. X (the input) becomes a 2D array. W stays the same. B also becomes a 1 x 3 2D array
- We are then defining a function and then using the Matmul function which carries out matrix multiplication.
- One thing to notice is that all the elements that is A_in, W, X, B are now 2D arrays. All of these are matrices.
- This turns out to be a very efficient implementation of one step of forward propagation through a dense layer in the neural network.

- One rule of Matrix multiplication is that we can take the dot product between a vector and a matrix only when they are of the same length.
- The numbers of columns of the first matrix should be equal to the number of rows of the second matrix
