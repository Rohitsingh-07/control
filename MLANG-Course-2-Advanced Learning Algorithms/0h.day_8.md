## Multiclass

- Multiclass classification refers to classification problems where we can have more than just two possible output labels so not just 0 or 1. In case of the hand written digit classification problem, we were trying to determine whether the digit is 0 or 1, but when we would try to identify a zip code or read protocols, there could be 10 possible diigts that we might want to recon=gnize.
