# Bias and Variance

## Diagnosing bias and variance

- The typical workflow of developing a machine learning system is that we have an idea and we train the model. Looking at the bias and variance of a learning algorithm gives us very good guidance on what to try next.
- We can think of the example we used to explain underfitting and overfitting of an algorithm on the dataset. Here, we can see that trying to fit a straight line doesn't work on the data. If we were to fit a 4th order polynomial, then it has high variance or it overfits.
