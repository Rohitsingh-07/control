```
# for array computations and loading data
import numpy as np

# for building linear regression models and preparing data
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# for building and training neural networks
import tensorflow as tf

# custom functions
import utils

# reduce display precision on numpy arrays
np.set_printoptions(precision=2)

# suppress warnings
tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')
tf.autograph.set_verbosity(0)
```

- We import linear regression module, Standardscaler to normalize the data and polynomial features to fit hte data in a polynomial expression. Test_train_split to split the data into two different training set and Mean squared error to get the Mean squared error
- First, you will be tasked to develop a model for a regression problem. You are given the dataset below consisting of 50 examples of an input feature `x` and its corresponding target `y`.

```
# Load the dataset from the text file
data = np.loadtxt('./data/data_w3_ex1.csv', delimiter=',')

# Split the inputs and outputs into separate arrays
x = data[:,0]
y = data[:,1]

# Convert 1-D arrays into 2-D because the commands later will require it
x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=1)
y = np.expand_dims(y, axis=1)

print(f"the shape of the inputs x is: {x.shape}")
print(f"the shape of the targets y is: {y.shape}")

Output:
the shape of the inputs x is: (50, 1)
the shape of the targets y is: (50, 1)
```

- We are using expand dims to convert a 1D array into 2D column vectors
