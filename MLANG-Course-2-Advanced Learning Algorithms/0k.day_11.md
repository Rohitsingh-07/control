## Advice for applying machine learning

- Let's assume, we implemented a regularized linear regression to predict housing prices, so we have the usual cost function for the learning algorithm, squared error plus the regularization term. But if we train the model, and find that it makes unacceptably large errors in it's predictions.
- When we are building a machine learning algorithm, there are usually a lot of different things we could try. For example, we could decide on
  - Getting more training examples
  - Try smaller set of features
  - Try getting additional features
  - Try adding polynomial features (x1^2, x2^2, x1x2, etc)
  - Try decreasing Lambda
  - Try increasing Lambda

- On any given machine learning application, it will often turn out that some of these things could be fruitful and some things not fruitful
- The key to being effective at how we build a machine learning algorithm will be if we can find a way to make good choices about where to invest the time
- For example: some times getting more training examples or getting more data helps and sometimes it doesn't.

- By diagnostic, which is a test that we can run to gain insight into what is or isn't working with learning algorithm to gain guidance into improving its performance.
- Some of these diagnostics will tell us things like, is it worth weeks, or even months collecting more training data, which will hopefully lead to improved performance, or if it isn't then running that diagnostic could have saved our time
- Diagnostic can take time to implement, but running them can be a very good use of our time.
