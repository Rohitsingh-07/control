- EEZ - Exclusive Economic Zone </br>
It is a sea zone prescribed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which extends up to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the baseline (usually the coastline) of a coastal state.
Within this zone, the coastal state has special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources, including energy production from water and wind. However, it does not have sovereignty over the EEZ as it would over its territorial waters. The EEZ is mainly for resource rights, not territorial control.
