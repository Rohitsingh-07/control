- EEZ - Exclusive Economic Zone </br>
It is a sea zone prescribed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which extends up to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the baseline (usually the coastline) of a coastal state.
Within this zone, the coastal state has special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources, including energy production from water and wind. However, it does not have sovereignty over the EEZ as it would over its territorial waters. The EEZ is mainly for resource rights, not territorial control.

Day_2

- We created a python file which distribute the whole dataset in small chunks of csv which has only 100000 rows in each csv file. The csv has the given columns and we intend to know the meaning of each</br>
1.MMSI</br>
2.BaseDateTime</br>
3.LAT</br>
4.LON</br>
5.SOG</br>
6.COG</br>
7.Heading</br>
8.VesselName</br>
9.IMO</br>
10.CallSign</br>
11.VesselType</br>
12.Status</br>
13.Length</br>
14.Width</br>
15.Draft</br>
16.Cargo</br>
17.TransceiverClass</br>

Day 3

- SOG is Speed over Ground
- COG is Course over Ground
- We look at the top 5 vessels which have the most data associated with them
- We check the distribution of vessels

```
for mmsi in top_mmsis.index[:3]:
    track = df[df['MMSI'] == mmsi]
    plt.plot(track['LON'], track['LAT'], marker='o', linestyle='-', label=f"MMSI {mmsi}", alpha=0.6)
```

- This code here plots the longitude and latitude of the Vessel MMSI of the top 3 vessels
- We check for potential spoofing of the vessels with incorrect or invalid latitudes and longitudes
- We check the events where the SOG Speend on Ground for given vessels was less and how many times that happened
- We download the shape file from the given link
