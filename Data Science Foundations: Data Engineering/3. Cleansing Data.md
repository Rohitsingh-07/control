- Data Conversion: Convert raw data into analytical formats by changing numeric values to integers, doubles, etc., and date values to date types.
- Cleansing Data: Create a cleansed sales table with appropriate data types, ensuring better usability for analysis.
- Quality Assurance: Perform data quality checks to identify any issues during the conversion process, ensuring the integrity of the cleansed data.

- Filtering Rows: Remove rows with missing key fields, such as OrderId, which are essential for later analysis.
- Replacing Invalid Dates: Use a placeholder value (e.g., 9999-12-31) for invalid dates to ensure consistency.
- Handling Missing Product Keys: Replace missing product keys with a recognizable placeholder (e.g., "unknown") to maintain data integrity.

- Creating a Zip Code Lookup Table: Set up a reference table in Hadoop to store zip code data.
- Identifying Invalid Combinations: Find and log invalid city and state combinations by comparing them with the lookup table.
- Updating Data: Replace incorrect city and state combinations in your data with the correct ones from the lookup table.
