- Creating Staging and Cleansed Tables: Set up a staging table for raw client data and a cleansed version with appropriate data types.
- Loading Data: Load data into the staging table and then transfer it to the cleansed table, converting fields to the correct data types.
- Updating Sales Table: Use the cleansed client table to update the ClientID in the sales table, ensuring data consistency and completeness.
