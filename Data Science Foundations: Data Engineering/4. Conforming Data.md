- Creating Staging and Cleansed Tables: Set up a staging table for raw client data and a cleansed version with appropriate data types.
- Loading Data: Load data into the staging table and then transfer it to the cleansed table, converting fields to the correct data types.
- Updating Sales Table: Use the cleansed client table to update the ClientID in the sales table, ensuring data consistency and completeness.

- Inferred Members: These are new records, such as a new client, that appear in the data feed but don't yet exist in the lookup tables.
- Order of Operations: First, check the client table for new clients and add them if they don't exist. Then, load the new sales data into the sales table.
- Data Warehousing Term: This process is known as inferred member support and is essential for maintaining data integrity when new related data appears.
