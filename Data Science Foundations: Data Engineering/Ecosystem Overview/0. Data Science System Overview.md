- Data Sources and Data Hub: Data comes from real-time events and data at rest, which are processed and stored in a central Data Hub.
- Back Office and Front Office: The Data Hub is divided into a Back Office (where data is staged, cleansed, and conformed) and a Front Office (where analysts and data scientists access clean, structured data).
- Data Processing Phases: The Back Office involves three phases: staging (landing raw data), cleansing (cleaning and transforming data), and conforming (standardizing data for analysis).

This structure helps ensure that data is well-organized and ready for analysis by different teams within an organization.

# The STAR Schema

- The Idea of STAR schema is that the Fact table is the centre point of the ecosystem and the dimension tables are in 5 different points which make a star like structure
- It resembles that the fact table can be used with respect to any dimension table using a simple join

- Star Schema Structure: A star schema consists of fact tables (numerical data) and dimension tables (contextual data) arranged in a star-like shape.
- Facts and Dimensions: Facts are numerical and stored at the atomic grain (lowest level of detail), while dimensions are textual and provide context for the facts.
- Usage in Analysis: Dimensions are used to "slice and dice" data in BI tools, allowing for detailed analysis based on various attributes like time, location, and product.
