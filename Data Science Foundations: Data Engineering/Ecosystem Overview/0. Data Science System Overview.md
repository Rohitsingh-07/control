- Data Sources and Data Hub: Data comes from real-time events and data at rest, which are processed and stored in a central Data Hub.
- Back Office and Front Office: The Data Hub is divided into a Back Office (where data is staged, cleansed, and conformed) and a Front Office (where analysts and data scientists access clean, structured data).
- Data Processing Phases: The Back Office involves three phases: staging (landing raw data), cleansing (cleaning and transforming data), and conforming (standardizing data for analysis).

This structure helps ensure that data is well-organized and ready for analysis by different teams within an organization.
