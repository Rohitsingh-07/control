- Insert and Update Dimension Records: Before loading fact records, insert and update any new dimension records such as clients, products, and locations.
- Load Fact Records: After updating dimensions, load the fact records (e.g., sales data) and perform lookups on associated dimensions to ensure all IDs match.
- Star Schema Structure: The star schema consists of a central fact table (e.g., sales) surrounded by dimension tables, which helps in simplifying data analysis through joins.
