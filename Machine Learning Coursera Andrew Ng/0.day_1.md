### Overview of Machine Learning

- Machine Learning: It's the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed
- Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
- Samuel's claim to fame was that back in the 1950s, he wrote a checkers playing program. The amazing thing about this program was that Arthur Samuel himself wasn't a very good checkers player. What he did was he had programmed the computer to play maybe tens of thousands of games against itself. By watching what social support positions tend to lead to wins and what positions tend to lead to losses the checkers plane program learned over time what are good or bad suport positions by trying to get a good and avoid bad positions, this program learned to get better and better at playing checkers because the computer had the patience to play tens of thousands of games against itself. It was able to get so much checkers playing experience that eventually it became a better checkers player than also, Samuel himself
