### Overview of Machine Learning

- Machine Learning: It's the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed
- Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
- Samuel's claim to fame was that back in the 1950s, he wrote a checkers playing program. The amazing thing about this program was that Arthur Samuel himself wasn't a very good checkers player. What he did was he had programmed the computer to play maybe tens of thousands of games against itself. By watching what social support positions tend to lead to wins and what positions tend to lead to losses the checkers plane program learned over time what are good or bad suport positions by trying to get a good and avoid bad positions, this program learned to get better and better at playing checkers because the computer had the patience to play tens of thousands of games against itself. It was able to get so much checkers playing experience that eventually it became a better checkers player than also, Samuel himself

### Supervised Learning

- I think 99 percent of the economic value created by machine learning today is through one type of machine learning, which is called supervised learning
- Supervised machine learning or more commonly, supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings. The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from. That includes the right answers, whereby right answer, I mean, the correct label y for a given input x, and is by seeing correct pairs of input x and desired output label y that the learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives a reasonably accurate prediction or guess of the output.
- Let's look at some examples. If the input x is an email and the output y is this email, spam or not spam, this gives you your spam filter. Or if the input is an audio clip and the algorithm's job is output the text transcript, then this is speech recognition. Or if you want to input English and have it output to corresponding Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, or something else translation, then that's machine translation. Or the most lucrative form of supervised learning today is probably used in online advertising. Nearly all the large online ad platforms have a learning algorithm that inputs some information about an ad and some information about you and then tries to figure out if you will click on that ad or not. Because by showing you ads they're just slightly more likely to click on, for these large online ad platforms, every click is revenue, this actually drives a lot of revenue for these companies
- Or if you want to build a self-driving car, the learning algorithm would take as input an image and some information from other sensors such as a radar or other things and then try to output the position of, say, other cars so that your self-driving car can safely drive around the other cars
- You can have a learning algorithm takes as input a picture of a manufactured product, say a cell phone that just rolled off the production line and have the learning algorithm output whether or not there is a scratch, dent, or other defect in the product. This is called visual inspection and it's helping manufacturers reduce or prevent defects in their products
- In all of these applications, you will first train your model with examples of inputs x and the right answers, that is the labels y. After the model has learned from these input, output, or x and y pairs, they can then take a brand new input x, something it has never seen before, and try to produce the appropriate corresponding output y

- Say you want to predict housing prices based on the size of the house. You've collected some data and say you plot the data and it looks like this. Here on the horizontal axis is the size of the house in square feet. Yes, I live in the United States where we still use square feet. I know most of the world uses square meters. Here on the vertical axis is the price of the house in, say, thousands of dollars. With this data, let's say a friend wants to know what's the price for their 750 square foot house. How can the learning algorithm help you? One thing a learning algorithm might be able to do is say, for the straight line to the data and reading off the straight line, it looks like your friend's house could be sold for maybe about, I don't know, $150,000. But fitting a straight line isn't the only learning algorithm you can use. There are others that could work better for this application. For example, routed and fitting a straight line, you might decide that it's better to fit a curve, a function that's slightly more complicated or more complex than a straight line. If you do that and make a prediction here, then it looks like, well, your friend's house could be sold for closer to $200,000. One of the things you see later in this class is how you can decide whether to fit a straight line, a curve, or another function that is even more complex to the data. Now, it doesn't seem appropriate to pick the one that gives your friend the best price, but one thing you see is how to get an algorithm to systematically choose the most appropriate line or curve or other thing to fit to this data. What you've seen in this slide is an example of supervised learning. Because we gave the algorithm a dataset in which the so-called right answer, that is the label or the correct price y is given for every house on the plot. The task of the learning algorithm is to produce more of these right answers, specifically predicting what is the likely price for other houses like your friend's house. That's why this is supervised learning. To define a little bit more terminology, this housing price prediction is the particular type of supervised learning called regression. By regression, I mean we're trying to predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers such as the house prices in our example, which could be 150,000 or 70,000 or 183,000 or any other number in between

- That's supervised learning, learning input, output, or x to y mappings
- But there's also a second major type of supervised learning problem called classification

#### Classification
- So supervised learning algorithms learn to predict input, output or X to Y mapping. Till now, we saw the type of supervised learning algorithm that learns to predict the numbers out of infinitely many possible numbers. There's a second major type of supervised learning algorithm called a classification algorithm. Take breast cancer detection as an example of a classification problem. Say you're building a machine learning system so that doctors can have a diagnostic tool to detect breast cancer. This is important because early detection could potentially save a patient's life. Using a patient's medical records your machine learning system tries to figure out if a tumor that is a lump is malignant meaning cancerous or dangerous. Or if that tumor, that lump is benign, meaning that it's just a lump that isn't cancerous and isn't that dangerous?
- Let's say our dataset has tumors of various sizes and these tumors are labeled as either benign (labeled as 0) or malignant (labeled as 1). We can then plot the data on the graph where the horizontal axis (x axis) would represent the tumor size and the vertical axis takes on only two values 0 or 1 based on the tumor size data.
- One reason why this is different from regression is that we're trying to predict only a small number of possible outputs or categories. This is different from regression which tries to predict any number, all of the infinitely many number of possible numbers.
- The fact that there are only two possible output is what makes this is classification algorithm

- We can plot the given data in two forms
  1. In the form of a two axis graph
  2. In the form of a single line

- Let's say that we have a patient who comes in with a tumor size which is marked with an arrow which is not falling under our benign or malignant category. For this situation what would the model do?
- Classification problems can have more than two possible output categories. Maybe, the learning algorithm can output multiple types of cancer diagnosis if it turns out to be malignant.
- So, let's call two different types of cancer type 1 and type 2. In this case, the algorithm would have three possible output categories it could predict.
- FYI, In classification the terms output classes and output categories are often used interchangeably.

- The above is a representation of a more than two possible output classes
- To summarize, classfication algorithms predict categories or classes.
- Categories don't have to be numbers. It could be non numeric. examples are below
  1. It can predict whether a picture is a cat or dog
  2. It can predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant
  3. Categories can also be numbers like 0,1 or 0,1,2
 
- The difference between classification and regression is that classification when predicting numbers predicts a small finite limited set of possible output categories such as 0,1 and 2 but not all possible numbers in between like 0.5 or 1.7. In the above example, we only had one input value in the size of the tumor. But we can also use more than one input value to predict an output.

- Let's take an example where instead of just knowing the tumor size of the patient, we also have each patient's age in years. We now have two inputs, age and tumor size. In the figure above we make it bovious that the **X** is the Malignant and **O** is the Benign one. Also, to predict if the patient's tumor is benign or malignant. The learning algorithm might find some boundary that separates out the malignant tumors from the benign ones. So, the learning algorithm has to decide how to fit a boundary line through this data. The boundary line found by the learning algorithm would help the doctor with the diagnosis.
- In this case, the tumor is more likely to be benign. 
- So to recap supervised learning maps input x to output y, where the learning algorithm learns from the quote right answers
- The two major types of supervised learning are regression and classification. In a regression application like predicting prices of houses, the learning algorithm has to predict numbers from infinitely many possible output numbers. Whereas in classification the learning algorithm has to make a prediction of a category, all of a small set of possible outputs.
