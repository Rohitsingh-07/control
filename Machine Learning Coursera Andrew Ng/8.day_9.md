## Optional Lab Gradient Descent

- In this lab, we automate the process of optimizing w and b using gradient descent
- The tools that we use are Numpy, Matplotlib and labs_util.py file

```
import math, copy
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('./deeplearning.mplstyle')
from lab_utils_uni import plt_house_x, plt_contour_wgrad, plt_divergence, plt_gradients
```

- We import the required files and the libraries
- We are using the same examples that we used previously in our old labs
```
# Load our data set
x_train = np.array([1.0, 2.0])   #features
y_train = np.array([300.0, 500.0])   #target value
```

- The compute cost function that we created last time and we are using this time

```
#Function to calculate the cost
def compute_cost(x, y, w, b):
   
    m = x.shape[0] 
    cost = 0
    
    for i in range(m):
        f_wb = w * x[i] + b
        cost = cost + (f_wb - y[i])**2
    total_cost = 1 / (2 * m) * cost

    return total_cost
```

### Gradient descent summary
So far in this course, you have developed a linear model that predicts $f_{w,b}(x^{(i)})$:
$$f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) = wx^{(i)} + b \tag{1}$$
In linear regression, you utilize input training data to fit the parameters $w$,$b$ by minimizing a measure of the error between our predictions $f_{w,b}(x^{(i)})$ and the actual data $y^{(i)}$. The measure is called the $cost$, $J(w,b)$. In training you measure the cost over all of our training samples</br>
$x^{(i)},y^{(i)}$ </br>
$$J(w,b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2\tag{2}$$ 


In lecture, *gradient descent* was described as:

$$
\text{repeat until convergence:} \quad
\begin{cases}
w = w - \alpha \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial w} \\
b = b - \alpha \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial b}
\end{cases}
$$

where parameters \( w \), \( b \) are updated **simultaneously**.

The gradient is defined as:

$$
\frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) x^{(i)}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})
$$

Here, **simultaneously** means that you calculate the partial derivatives for all the parameters **before updating any** of the parameters.

### Implement Gradient Descent
- You will implement gradient descent algorithm for one feature. You will need three functions.
- We will compute the partial derivative functions by creating a function out of it and then we will move ahead

- Compute Gradient Function

- Above, the left plot shows  ∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)/∂𝑤 or the slope of the cost curve relative to  𝑤 at three points. On the right side of the plot, the derivative is positive, while on the left it is negative. Due to the 'bowl shape', the derivatives will always lead gradient descent toward the bottom where the gradient is zero.
- The left plot has fixed  𝑏=100. Gradient descent will utilize both  ∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)/∂𝑤 and  ∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)/∂𝑏 to update parameters. The 'quiver plot' on the right provides a means of viewing the gradient of both parameters. The arrow sizes reflect the magnitude of the gradient at that point. The direction and slope of the arrow reflects the ratio of  ∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)/∂𝑤 and  ∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)/∂𝑏 at that point.
- Note that the gradient points away from the minimum. Review equation (3) above. The scaled gradient is subtracted from the current value of  𝑤 or  𝑏. This moves the parameter in a direction that will reduce cost.
