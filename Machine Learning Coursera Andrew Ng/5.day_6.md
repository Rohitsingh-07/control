## Visualizing the Cost Function

- The model's parameters w and b, the cost function J of w and b, as well as the goal of the linear regression, which is to minimize the cost function J of w and b over parameters w and b. In the last video, we had temporarily set b to zero in order to simplify the visualizations.
- Here we have a training set of house sizes and prices. I've set w to 0.06 and b to 50. f of x is 0.06 times x plus 50. We can see that the model seems to consistently underestimate housing prices.
- When we had only w, because we temporarily set b to zero to simplify things, but then we had come up with a plot of the cost function that look like a U shaped bowl as a function of w only.
- When we had only one parameter, w, the cost function had this U-shaped curve, shaped a bit like a soup bowl.

- In this housing price example, we have two parameters, w and b. The plots becomes a little more complex. It turns that the cost function also has a similar shape like a soup bowl, except in three dimensions instead of two.

- We see here a 3D surface plot where the axes are labeled w and b.
- As we vary w and b, which are the two parameters of the model, you get different values for the cost function J of w, and b.
- This is a lot like the U-shaped curve that we saw earlier, except instead of having one parameter w as input for the j, we now have two parameters, w and b as inputs.
- For example, if w was minus 10 and b was minus 15, then the height of the surface above this point is the value of j when w is minus 10 and b is minus 15
- In order to look more closely to specific points, there's another way of plotting the cost function J that would be useful for the visualization, which is rather than using these 3D-surface plots, we take this exact same function J and plotting it using a contour plot.

- This is one of the example of the contour plot where we are looking at Mount Fuji from the top

- Here at the bottom, we can see a 3D-surface plot of the cost function J.
- On the top right corner is a contour plot of this exact same cost function as that shown at the bottom. The two axes on this contour plots are b, on the vertical axis, and w on the horizontal axis.
- Each of these ovals, also called ellipses, show, is the center points on the 3D surface which are at the exact same height. In other words, the set of points which have the same value for the cost function J.
- If you take the 3 given points shown in the figure, all of these points have the same value of the cost function J, even though they have different values for w and b.
- In the upper left, we also see that these three points correspond to different functions, f, all three of which are actually pretty bad for predicting houses in this case.
- The bottom of the bowl, where the cost function J is at a minimum, is this point right here, at the center of this concentric ovals.
