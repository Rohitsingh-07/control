#### Optional Lab 2

- In the 2nd optional lab we use custome functions from the python file of labs_util_uni and labs_util_common

- In the common file,
  - we are creating a dictionary with the given colors that we need
  - we are creating a custom cost function to call whenever we need
  - In this cost function, we use verbose which is usually used to print the value of the predicted function f_wb. By default the verbose is false but still we call it because we can use it to debuf when required
