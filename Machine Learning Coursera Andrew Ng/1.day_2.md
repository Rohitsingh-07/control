### Unsupervised Learning
---

- After supervised learning, the most widely used form of machine learning is unsupervised learning.
- In supervised learning, each example is associated with an output label y such as benign or malignant. In unsupervised learning, we are given data that isn't associated with any output labels y, say we are given data on patients and their tumor size and the patient's age. But, not whether the tumor was benign or malignant. The diagram below shows the Supervised learning and unsupervised learning plots

- We are not asked to diagnose whether the tumor is benign or malignant, because we are not given any labels **Y** in the dataset. Instead, our job is to find some structure or some pattern or just something interesting in the data. This is called unsupervised learning, we call it unsupervised because we're not trying to supervise the algorithm to give some "right answer" for every input. Instead, we asked the algorithm to figure out all by itself what's interesting. Or what patterns or structures that might be in this data, with this particular dataset.
- An unsupervised learning algorithm, might decide that the data can be assigned to two different groups or two different clusters. This is a particular type of unsupervised learning, called a clustering algorithm because it places the unlabeled data, into different clusters and this turns out to be used in many applications.

- Google news uses clustering as every day it goes and looks at hundreds of thousands of news articles on the internet, and groups related stories together.

- Here, as you can see, the words **Panda**, **Twin** and **zoo** appears in all of these articles.
- The clustering algorithm is finding articles, all of all the hundreds and thousands of news articles on the internet that day, finding the articles that mention similar words and grouping them into clusters.
- This clustering algorithm figures out on his own which words suggest, that certain articles are in the same group.
- Let's look at the 2nd example of Unsupervised learning applied to clustering genetic or DNA data.

- This image shows a picture of DNA micro array data, these look like tiny grids of a spreadsheet. And each tiny column represents the genetic or DNA activity of one person. Here, one column is from one person's DNA and each row represents a particular gene.
- With this help, we can see that how many different individuals have a specific gene active and then we can run a clustering algorithm to group individuals into different categories. Then based on this grouping the algorithm will put them in Type 1 or Type 2 group and this is unsupervised learnin because we are not telling the algorithm in advance, that there is a type one person with certain characteristics. Or a type two person with certain characteristics, instead what we're saying is here's a bunch of data. I don't know what the different types of people are but can you automatically find structure into data. And automatically figure out whether the major types of individuals.
- Another example of unsupervised learning, many companies group customers into certain groups to serve them more efficiently.
- So to summarize a clustering alogorithm, which is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm, takes data without labels and tries to automatically group them into clusters.
