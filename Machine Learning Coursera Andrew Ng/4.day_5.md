## Cost Function Formula

- In order to implement linear regression the first key step is first to define something called a cost function
- The cost function tells us how well the model is doing so that we can try to get it to do better.
- Recall that you have a training set that contains input features x and output targets y. The model you're going to use to fit this training set is this linear function f_w, b of x equals to w times x plus b. To introduce a little bit more terminology the w and b are called the parameters of the model. Parameters of the model are variables that we can adjust during training in order to improve the model.
- We also refer to the parameters of a model as coefficients or weights. Depending on the values we chose for w and b we get a different function f of x, which generates a different line on the graph.

- Above is the diagram which shows the line graph for different values of w and b incorporated in the function f. We take the vlaue of x and change it between 0 and 1 and get the points to plot for the function.
- We need to also make sure that the slope of the function should be correct and is calculated accordingly.
