## Cost Function Formula

- In order to implement linear regression the first key step is first to define something called a cost function
- The cost function tells us how well the model is doing so that we can try to get it to do better.
- Recall that you have a training set that contains input features x and output targets y. The model you're going to use to fit this training set is this linear function f_w, b of x equals to w times x plus b. To introduce a little bit more terminology the w and b are called the parameters of the model. Parameters of the model are variables that we can adjust during training in order to improve the model.
- We also refer to the parameters of a model as coefficients or weights. Depending on the values we chose for w and b we get a different function f of x, which generates a different line on the graph.

- Above is the diagram which shows the line graph for different values of w and b incorporated in the function f. We take the vlaue of x and change it between 0 and 1 and get the points to plot for the function.
- We need to also make sure that the slope of the function should be correct and is calculated accordingly.
- For a given training set, with the help of linear regression we need to choose the values of the parameters w and b so that the straight line we get from the function f somehow fits the data well.
- A line that fits the data well can mean a line defined by f which is roughly passing through or somehwere close to the training examples as compared to other possible lines that are not as close to these points
- To remind, a training example like this point here is defined by x superscript i, y superscript i where y is the target (x^i, y^i).
- For a given input x^i, the function f also makes a predictive value for y and a value that it predicts to y is y hat i shown here. For our choice of a model f of x^i is w times x^i plus b
- Stated differently, the prediction y hat i is f of wb of x^i where for the model we're using f of x^i is equal to wx^i plus b

- The goal is to find the values of w and b which keeps the prediction y^hat close to the true target y^i for many or maybe all training examples x^i, y^i. In order to find that, let's first take a look at how to measure how well a line fits the training data
- To do that, we're going to construct a cost function.
- The cost function takes the prediction y hat and compares it to the target y by taking y hat minus y. This difference is called the error. 
- We are measuring how far off to prediction is from the target. Next, let's compute the square of this error. Also, we're going to want to compute this term for different training examples i in the training set.
- When measuring the error, for example i, we'll compute this squared error term.
- Since we want to measure the error accross the entire training set, let's sum up the squared errors. We'll sum up from i equals 1 to m where m is the no of training examples.
- If we have more training examples, m is larger and the cost function will calculate a bigger number.
- To build a cost function that doesn't automatically get bigger as the training set size get larger by convention, we will compute the average square error instead of the total squared error and we do that by dividing by m.
- By convention, the cost function that machine learning people use actually divides by 2 times m. The extra division by 2 is just meant to make some of our later calculations look neater, but the cost function still works whether you include this division by 2 or not
- This cost function is referred to as J of wb. It is also called squared error cost function because we are taking square of these error terms.
- In machine learning different people will use different cost functions for different applications, but the squared error cost function is by far the most commonly used one for linear regression and for that matter, for all regression problems where it seems to give good results for many applications

- Above, as you can we we have the whole convention on how we can write the function and its mathematical formula.
