## Unsupervised Learning - Part 2
---

- In supervised learning, the data comes only with inputs x and input labels y, in unsupervised learning, the data comes only with inputs x but not output labels y, and the algorithm has to find some structure or some pattern or something interesting in the data.
- As we saw clustering, we are also going to see other types of unsupervised learning that is anomaly detection, which is used to detect unusual events. This turns out to be really important for fraud detection in the financial system, where unusual events, unusual transactions could be signs of fraud and for many other applications.
- Another type is dimensionality reduction. This lets you take a big data-set and almost magically compress it to a much smaller data-set while losing as little information as possible.

## Linear Regression Model - Part 1
---

- Linear Regression model just means fitting a straight line to your data.
- Let's consider an example where we want to predict the price of a house based on its size.

- This the plot of the housing data where we have the house of 1250 Sq.feet for which we have to predict the price. Here, we can build a linear regression model which will fit a straight line to the data.

- This is supervised learning because we are first training a model by giving a data that has right answers because we get the model example of houses with both the size of the house, as well as the price that the model should predict
- This linear regression model is a particular type of supervised learning model. It's called regression model because it predicts numbers as the output like prices in dollars.
- Any supervised learning model that predicts a number such as 220,000 or 1.5 or negative 33.2 is addressing what's called a regression problem. Linear regression is one example of a regression model
- In contrast of the regression model, the other most common type of supervised learning model is called a classification model.
- Classification model predicts categories or discrete categories, such as predicting if a picture is of a cat or a dog, or if given medical record, it has to predict if a patient has a particular disease.
- As a reminder about the difference between classification and regression, in classification, there are only a small number of possible outputs
- Some notations are used in Machine learning that would be beneficial for us going forward
- The dataset that is used to train the model is called the training dataset.
- To predict the price of the client's house. We first train the model to learn from the training set and the model can then predict the client's house price.
- In Machine Learning, the standard notation to denote the input here is lowercase x, and we call this the input variable, is also called a feature or an input feature.
- The standard notation to denote the output variable which you're trying to predict, which is also sometimes called the target variable, is lowercase y

  
- x = "input" variable / feature
- y = "output" variable / "target" variable

- There are 47 rows in the data which are the training examples. We have 47 training examples in the data which we denote as **m** and here m = 47.
- A single training example looks like this (x,y)
- To refer to a specific training example, this will correspond to a specific row in this table on the left, I'm going to use the notation x superscript in parenthesis, i, y superscript in parentheses i
- The superscript tells us that this is the ith training example, such as the first, second, or third up to the 47th training example.
