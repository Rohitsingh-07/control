# Roadmap

✅ 2. 90-Day Learning & Practice Roadmap (Week-by-Week)

Goal: Become interview-ready, portfolio-ready, and network-ready within 12 weeks.

Phase 1: Strengthen Fundamentals (Weeks 1–4)
Week 1–2: Revision & Skill Polishing

SQL

Practice window functions, CTEs, joins, aggregations.

Work on LeetCode SQL, StrataScratch.

Dashboards

Build 1 Tableau or Power BI dashboard using open datasets.

Statistics refresher

Hypothesis testing, distributions, confidence intervals.

Week 3–4: Communication + Business Context

Practice translating insights into business recommendations.

Write 3 mock case studies summarizing past projects:

Objective

Tools used

Approach

Insights

Business impact

Build a clean portfolio using GitHub or Notion.

Phase 2: Build Strong Projects (Weeks 5–8)
Week 5–6: 1 Data Analyst portfolio project

Data cleaning + SQL + dashboard + insights.

Example: Analyze NYC taxi data, build a pipeline, create a story.

Week 7–8: 1 Business Analyst project

Choose a business problem → analyze → propose metrics → build dashboard → add recommendations.

Example: Churn analysis, funnel drop-off analysis, or profitability analysis.

Add one more project:

End-to-end analytics pipeline with Python + SQL + Dashboard.

Phase 3: Interview & Job Search Prep (Weeks 9–12)
Week 9–10: Interview prep

SQL interview drills (StrataScratch, InterviewQuery).

Product/analytics case studies:

A/B testing

Metrics design

Root cause analysis

Week 11: Resume + LinkedIn Optimization

Make a US-style resume → action verbs + quantifiable impact.

Add your 3 portfolio projects.

Ask professors/recent grads for 2–3 referrals.

Week 12: Networking & Applications

Attend 2–3 in-person university events weekly.

Send 5–10 LinkedIn networking messages daily.

Aim for 80% referral-based applications.

✅ 3. Skills, Tools & Concepts You Should Master
Must-Have Skills (For DA/BA roles in US)

SQL (advanced: CTEs, window functions, optimization)

Excel (pivots, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, Power Query)

Dashboard tools: Tableau OR Power BI

Python for analytics: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn

Statistics & experimentation basics

Business understanding: OKRs, KPIs, funnel metrics

Data storytelling & clear communication

Good-to-Have Skills (Become a stronger candidate)

Analytics engineering: DBT, Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift

Basic ML for analytics (regression, clustering—not deep learning)

A/B testing frameworks

Git & version control

Cloud familiarity (AWS/GCP)

SQL query performance tuning

Basic product analytics tools (Mixpanel, Amplitude)

✅ 4. Portfolio Plan — 3 to 5 Strong Projects
🔹 Project 1: End-to-End Sales Analytics Pipeline (DA + BA)

Clean data using Python

Store in SQL

Build a Power BI/Tableau dashboard

Generate insights → recommend business actions

🔹 Project 2: Customer Churn & Retention Analysis

Define KPIs

Build cohort analysis

Create dashboard → retention actions

🔹 Project 3: A/B Testing Simulation

Create an experiment dataset

Perform hypothesis testing

Present results → decision recommendation

🔹 Project 4: Real-World SQL Challenge Project

Use a large dataset (e.g., 80M+ rows)

Optimize complex queries

Document your thinking

🔹 Project 5: Marketing Funnel Analysis

Analyze user journeys

Find leakage

Recommend product/marketing actions

Each project should have:

Clean README

Screenshots of dashboards

Clear business story

GitHub + LinkedIn post about it

✅ 5. Networking, LinkedIn & Job Search Strategy (US-Specific)
Weekly Networking Routine (Very Effective for International Students)

Attend career fairs, department events, tech meetups.

Message alumni:
“Hi, I’m also a student at ___—wanted to learn about your experience as a DA/BA.”

Ask for informational interviews, not jobs.

LinkedIn Optimization

Headline:
“Data Analyst | Business Analyst | 3 Years Experience | SQL • Python • Tableau | MS Data Science (US)”

About section:
Story + skills + tools + projects + what you’re looking for.

Post weekly:

Projects

Learnings

Insights

Job Application Strategy

Don’t apply blindly online!

Aim for 30–40% direct applications

Aim for 60–70% referral-based applications

Join Slack/Discord communities for referrals

✅ 6. Common Interview Questions to Prepare For
Technical DA/BA Questions

SQL

“Write a query to find month-over-month growth.”

“Find the second highest revenue per customer.”

Dashboarding

“How do you choose the right chart type?”

A/B Testing

“How do you determine statistical significance?”

Metrics

“How would you design KPIs for a subscription product?”

Business cases

“Why is revenue dropping this month?”

“How would you reduce churn?”

Behavioral Questions

“Tell me about a time when your analysis influenced a business decision.”

“Describe a time you disagreed with a stakeholder.”

“Tell me about a complex SQL problem you solved.”

“How do you prioritize when multiple teams want data?”

“Explain a project end-to-end.”

Practice answers using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

✅ 7. Mistakes to Avoid (Especially as an International Student)

Applying without networking → very low interview rate.

Not quantifying resume bullets.

Overfocusing on ML when the role is analytics.

Ignoring communication skills—US recruiters value clarity over complexity.

Not translating past work into business outcomes.

Building too many random ML projects instead of clean analytics case studies.

Not preparing for behavioral interviews (huge in US hiring).

Waiting until the last semester to network.

Not using university resources (career center, career fairs).
