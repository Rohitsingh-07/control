## Python Dictionaries
```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
```

- Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates. Dictionaries are written with curly brackets
- As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
- Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and do not allow duplicates. Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])

Output - Ford
```

- Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
- Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)

Output - {'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 2020}
```

- To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function: ```print(len(thisdict))```
- The values in dictionary items can be of any data type:

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}

Output - {'brand': 'Ford', 'electric': False, 'year': 1964, 'colors': ['red', 'white', 'blue']}
```

- From Python's perspective, dictionaries are defined as objects with the data type 'dict': ```<class 'dict'>```
- It is also possible to use the dict() constructor to make a dictionary.

```
thisdict = dict(name = "John", age = 36, country = "Norway")
print(thisdict)
```

- You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:
- There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:
```x = thisdict.get("model")```

- The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary. ```x = thisdict.keys()```
- The list of the keys is a view of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the keys list.

```
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.keys()

print(x) #before the change

car["color"] = "white"

print(x) #after the change

Output -
dict_keys(['brand', 'model', 'year'])
dict_keys(['brand', 'model', 'year', 'color'])
```

- The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary. ```x = thisdict.values()```
- The list of the values is a view of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the values list.

- Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:

```
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.values()

print(x) #before the change

car["color"] = "red"

print(x) #after the change

Output -
dict_values(['Ford', 'Mustang', 1964])
dict_values(['Ford', 'Mustang', 1964, 'red'])
```

- The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.
```
x = thisdict.items()

dict_items([('brand', 'Ford'), ('model', 'Mustang'), ('year', 1964)])
```

- The returned list is a view of the items of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the items list.

  
- To determine if a specified key is present in a dictionary use the in keyword:

---
#### Change Dictionary Items
---

- You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name:
- The update() method will update the dictionary with the items from the given argument.
- The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value pairs.
- Update the "year" of the car by using the update() method:

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.update({"year": 2020})

{'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 2020}
```

- Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it:
  
- The update() method will update the dictionary with the items from a given argument. If the item does not exist, the item will be added.
- The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value pairs.

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.update({"color": "red"})
```
---

#### Python - Remove Dictionary Items

- The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)
```

- The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):
- The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)
```

- The del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely:
- The clear() method empties the dictionary:

---

#### Python - Loop Dictionaries

- You can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop. When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the keys of the dictionary, but there are methods to return the values as well.
- Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one: ``` for x in thisdict: print(x) ```

- Print all values in the dictionary, one by one: ```for x in thisdict: print(thisdict[x])```
- You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:```for x in thisdict.values(): print(x)```
- You can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:```for x in thisdict.keys(): print(x)```

- Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:```for x, y in thisdict.items(): print(x, y)```

---

#### Copy a Dictionary

- You cannot copy a dictionary simply by typing dict2 = dict1, because: dict2 will only be a reference to dict1, and changes made in dict1 will automatically also be made in dict2.
- There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in Dictionary method copy().
- Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)

Output - {'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 1964}
```

- Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in function dict().
```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)

Output - {'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 1964}
```

---

#### Python - Nested Dictionaries

- A dictionary can contain dictionaries, this is called nested dictionaries.
```
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}

Output -
{'child1': {'name': 'Emil', 'year': 2004}, 'child2': {'name': 'Tobias', 'year': 2007}, 'child3': {'name': 'Linus', 'year': 2011}}
```

- Or, if you want to add three dictionaries into a new dictionary: Create three dictionaries, then create one dictionary that will contain the other three dictionaries:
```
child1 = {
  "name" : "Emil",
  "year" : 2004
}
child2 = {
  "name" : "Tobias",
  "year" : 2007
}
child3 = {
  "name" : "Linus",
  "year" : 2011
}

myfamily = {
  "child1" : child1,
  "child2" : child2,
  "child3" : child3
}

print(myfamily)

Output - {'child1': {'name': 'Emil', 'year': 2004}, 'child2': {'name': 'Tobias', 'year': 2007}, 'child3': {'name': 'Linus', 'year': 2011}}
```

- To access items from a nested dictionary, you use the name of the dictionaries, starting with the outer dictionary:
```print(myfamily["child2"]["name"]) Output - Tobias```

- You can loop through a dictionary by using the items() method like this:
```
for x, obj in myfamily.items():
    print(x)
    
    for y in obj:
        print(y + ':', obj[y])

Output -
child1
name: Emil
year: 2004
child2
name: Tobias
year: 2007
child3
name: Linus
year: 2011
```
