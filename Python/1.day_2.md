- You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:
```
x = 5
print(type(x))
```

- In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:

- Setting the Specific Data Type, If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor functions:

### Python Numbers

- There are three numeric types in Python:
  1. int
  2. float
  3. complex

```
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex
```

- Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
```
x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

- Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
```
x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```
- Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
```
x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

- Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
```
x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

#### Type Conversion

- You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:

```
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

#convert from int to float:
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
```

- You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.
---

- Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
- Example: Import the random module, and display a random number from 1 to 9:
```
import random

print(random.randrange(1, 10))
```

---

#### Python Casting

- There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.
- Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:
1. int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
2. float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
3. str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals

```
x = int(1)   # x will be 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
z = int("3") # z will be 3
```

---

#### Python Strings

- Quotes Inside Quotes: You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

- Strings are Arrays
- Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

- Looping Through a String: Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.
```
for x in "banana":
  print(x)
```

- The len() function returns the length of a string:
- To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword **in**.
```
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)
```

- To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword **not in**.
---

#### Python - Slicing Strings

- You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
- Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

```
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])
```

```
# Get the characters from the start to position 5 (not included):
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])
```

```
# Get the characters from position 2, and all the way to the end:
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])
```

- Negative Indexing

```
# Get the characters:
# From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)
# To, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2):

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])
```

#### Python - Modify Strings

- The upper() method returns the string in upper case:
- The lower() method returns the string in lower case:
- The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:
- The replace() method replaces a string with another string:
```
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.replace("H", "J"))
```

- The split() method returns a list where the text between the specified separator becomes the list items.

---

#### Python - String Concatenation

- String Concatenation: To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the **+** operator.
```
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)
```

---

#### Python - Format - Strings

- We cannot combine strings and numbers as we saw it before, But we can combine strings and numbers by using f-strings or the format() method!

- To specify a string as an f-string, simply put an **f** in front of the string literal, and add curly brackets **{}** as placeholders for variables and other operations.

```
age = 36
txt = f"My name is John, I am {age}"
print(txt)
```

- A placeholder can contain variables, operations, functions, and modifiers to format the value.
- A placeholder can include a modifier to format the value.
- A modifier is included by adding a colon : followed by a legal formatting type, like .2f which means fixed point number with 2 decimals:

```
price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"
print(txt)
```

- A placeholder can contain Python code, like math operations:
```
# Perform a math operation in the placeholder, and return the result:

txt = f"The price is {20 * 59} dollars"
print(txt)
```

#### Python - Escape Characters

- Escape Character: To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
- An escape character is a backslash **\** followed by the character you want to insert.
- An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

```
txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."
```

- The escape character allows you to use double quotes when you normally would not be allowed:
``` txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north." ```

#### Python Booleans

- Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.
- In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.
- You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.
- When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:

- The bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return,
```
print(bool("Hello"))
print(bool(15))
```
- Both give output as True

- Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.
- Any string is True, except empty strings.
- Any number is True, except 0.
- Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

- In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0, and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.

```
bool(False)
bool(None)
bool(0)
bool("")
bool(())
bool([])
bool({})
```

- One more value, or object in this case, evaluates to False, and that is if you have an object that is made from a class with a __len__ function that returns 0 or False:
```
class myclass():
  def __len__(self):
    return 0

myobj = myclass()
print(bool(myobj))
```

- Functions can Return a Boolean. You can create functions that returns a Boolean Value:

```
def myFunction() :
  return True

print(myFunction())
```

- Python also has many built-in functions that return a boolean value, like the **isinstance()** function, which can be used to determine if an object is of a certain data type:

```
x = 200
print(isinstance(x, int))
```
