## Pyton If ... Else

- Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- Equals: a == b
- Not Equals: a != b
- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b

- An "if statement" is written by using the **if** keyword.

```
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

Output - b is greater than a
```

- The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

```
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")

Output - a and b are equal
```

- The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

- Ternary Operators, or Conditional Expressions are used when we have multiple else statements on the same line.
- AND, NOT, OR can be used in IF statement
- The Pass Statement - if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

```
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  pass
```

## Python Match 

- The match statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
- Instead of writing many **if else ** statements, we can use the match statement.
- The match statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed.

```
Syntax

match expression:
  case x:
    code block
  case y:
    code block
  case z:
    code block
```

- The match expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

```
Code - The example below uses the weekday number to print the weekday name:

day = 4
match day:
  case 1:
    print("Monday")
  case 2:
    print("Tuesday")
  case 3:
    print("Wednesday")
  case 4:
    print("Thursday")
  case 5:
    print("Friday")
  case 6:
    print("Saturday")
  case 7:
    print("Sunday")

Output - Thursday
```

- Default Value : Use the underscore character _ as the last case value if you want a code block to execute when there are not other matches

```
day = 4
match day:
  case 6:
    print("Today is Saturday")
  case 7:
    print("Today is Sunday")
  case _:
    print("Looking forward to the Weekend")

Output - Looking forward to the Weekend
```

- The value _ will always match, so it is important to place it as the last case to make it beahave as a default case.
- Combine Values: Use the pipe character | as an or operator in the case evaluation to check for more than one value match in one case.

```
day = 4
match day:
  case 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5:
    print("Today is a weekday")
  case 6 | 7:
    print("I love weekends!")

Output - Today is a weekday
```

- If Statements as Guards: You can add if statements in the case evaluation as an extra condition-check

```
month = 5
day = 4
match day:
  case 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 if month == 4:
    print("A weekday in April")
  case 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 if month == 5:
    print("A weekday in May")
  case _:
    print("No match")

Output - A weekday in May
```

## Python While Loops

- Python has two primitive loop commands: 1. While loops 2. For loops
- With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as the condition is true
- Make sure that the loop does not go into an infinite loop

- With the **Break** statement, we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true

```
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if (i == 3):
    break
  i += 1

Output -
1
2
3
```

- With the **continue** statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next

```
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)

Output -

1
2
4
5
6
```

- With the **else** statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true
