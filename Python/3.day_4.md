## Python - Sort Lists

- List objects have a sort() method that will sort the list alphanumerically, ascending, by default:

```
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)
```

- To sort descending, use the keyword argument reverse = True:
```
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort(reverse = True)
print(thislist)
```

#### Customize Sort Function

- You can also customize your own function by using the keyword argument key = function.
- The function will return a number that will be used to sort the list (the lowest number first)

```
def myfunc(n):
  return abs(n - 50)

thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort(key = myfunc)
print(thislist)

Output - [50, 65, 23, 82, 100]
```
Here the abs gives out absolute difference which gives a positive number even when the difference is negative.

- By default the sort() method is case sensitive, resulting in all capital letters being sorted before lower case letters:
- Luckily we can use built-in functions as key functions when sorting a list.
- So if you want a case-insensitive sort function, use str.lower as a key function:

```
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.sort(key = str.lower)
print(thislist)

Output - ['banana', 'cherry', 'Kiwi', 'Orange']
```

- The reverse() method reverses the current sorting order of the elements.
```
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.reverse()
print(thislist)

Output - ['cherry', 'Kiwi', 'Orange', 'banana']
```

#### Python - Copy Lists

- Copy a List. You cannot copy a list simply by typing list2 = list1, because: list2 will only be a reference to list1, and changes made in list1 will automatically also be made in list2.
- You can use the built-in List method copy() to copy a list.
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = thislist.copy()
print(mylist)

Output -
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

- Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in method list().
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = list(thislist)
print(mylist)
```

- You can also make a copy of a list by using the : (slice) operator.
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = thislist[:]
print(mylist)
```

#### Python - Join Lists

- There are several ways to join, or concatenate, two or more lists in Python. One of the easiest ways are by using the + operator.
```
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

list3 = list1 + list2
print(list3)
```

- Another way to join two lists is by appending all the items from list2 into list1, one by one
```
list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

for x in list2:
  list1.append(x)

print(list1)

Output - ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]
```

- Or you can use the extend() method, where the purpose is to add elements from one list to another list
```
list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)

Output - ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]
```
