## Python - Sort Lists

- List objects have a sort() method that will sort the list alphanumerically, ascending, by default:

```
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)
```

- To sort descending, use the keyword argument reverse = True:
```
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort(reverse = True)
print(thislist)
```

---

#### Customize Sort Function

- You can also customize your own function by using the keyword argument key = function.
- The function will return a number that will be used to sort the list (the lowest number first)

```
def myfunc(n):
  return abs(n - 50)

thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort(key = myfunc)
print(thislist)

Output - [50, 65, 23, 82, 100]
```
Here the abs gives out absolute difference which gives a positive number even when the difference is negative.

- By default the sort() method is case sensitive, resulting in all capital letters being sorted before lower case letters:
- Luckily we can use built-in functions as key functions when sorting a list.
- So if you want a case-insensitive sort function, use str.lower as a key function:

```
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.sort(key = str.lower)
print(thislist)

Output - ['banana', 'cherry', 'Kiwi', 'Orange']
```

- The reverse() method reverses the current sorting order of the elements.
```
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.reverse()
print(thislist)

Output - ['cherry', 'Kiwi', 'Orange', 'banana']
```

#### Python - Copy Lists

- Copy a List. You cannot copy a list simply by typing list2 = list1, because: list2 will only be a reference to list1, and changes made in list1 will automatically also be made in list2.
- You can use the built-in List method copy() to copy a list.
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = thislist.copy()
print(mylist)

Output -
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

- Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in method list().
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = list(thislist)
print(mylist)
```

- You can also make a copy of a list by using the : (slice) operator.
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = thislist[:]
print(mylist)
```
---

#### Python - Join Lists

- There are several ways to join, or concatenate, two or more lists in Python. One of the easiest ways are by using the + operator.
```
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

list3 = list1 + list2
print(list3)
```

- Another way to join two lists is by appending all the items from list2 into list1, one by one
```
list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

for x in list2:
  list1.append(x)

print(list1)

Output - ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]
```

- Or you can use the extend() method, where the purpose is to add elements from one list to another list
```
list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)

Output - ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]
```

## Python Tuples

- Tuples are used to save multiple items in a single variable.
- Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
- A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Tuples are written with round brackets.

```
# Create a tuple

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

Output -
('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
```

- Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
- Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
- When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
- Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
- Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value
- Tuples allow duplicate values:
```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

Output 
('apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'apple', 'cherry')
```

- len() function can be used to determine the no of items in a tuple
```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(thistuple))
```

- To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.
```
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))

Output -
<class 'tuple'>
<class 'str'>
```

- Tuple items can be of any data type:
```
tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)
tuple3 = (True, False, False)
```
- A tuple can contain different data types: ```tuple1 = ("abc", 34, True, 40, "male")```
- type() is used to determine the data type of a tuple. From Python's perspective, tuples are defined as objects with the data type 'tuple':

- It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple. ```thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets```

- There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
  -List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
  -Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
  -Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
  -Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

#### Python - Access Tuple Items

- You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets:
```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple[1])
```

- We can also use negative indexing in tuples
- You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range. When specifying a range, the return value will be a new tuple with the specified items.
- To determine if a specified item is present in a tuple use the in keyword:
- Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that you cannot change, add, or remove items once the tuple is created. But there are some workarounds.
- Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called. But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.
```
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print(x)

Output - ("apple", "kiwi", "cherry")
```

- Since tuples are immutable, they do not have a built-in append() method, but we can use the same as before step to add items in a tuple
- Add tuple to a tuple. You are allowed to add tuples to tuples, so if you want to add one item, (or many), create a new tuple with the item(s), and add it to the existing tuple:
```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = ("orange",)
thistuple += y

print(thistuple)
Output -

('apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange')
```

- Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it, but you can use the same workaround as we used for changing and adding tuple items:
```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.remove("apple")
thistuple = tuple(y)
```

- The del keyword can delete the tuple completely:
```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
del thistuple
print(thistuple) #this will raise an error because the tuple no longer exists

```

- When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple. But, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking"
```
# Unpacking a tuple
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

(green, yellow, red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)

Output -
apple
banana
cherry
```

- The number of variables must match the number of values in the tuple, if not, you must use an asterisk to collect the remaining values as a list.
- If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an * to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the variable as a list:

```
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "strawberry", "raspberry")

(green, yellow, *red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)

Output -
apple
banana
['cherry', 'strawberry', 'raspberry']
```

- If the asterisk is added to another variable name than the last, Python will assign values to the variable until the number of values left matches the number of variables left.
```
fruits = ("apple", "mango", "papaya", "pineapple", "cherry")

(green, *tropic, red) = fruits

print(green)
print(tropic)
print(red)

Output-
apple
['mango', 'papaya', 'pineapple']
cherry
```
