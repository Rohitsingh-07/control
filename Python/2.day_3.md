## Python Operators
---

- Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values
- Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators
- Bitwise operators

- Order Precedence describes the order in which operations are performed

## Lists

- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
- Lists are created using square brackets:
- List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
- List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
- When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
- If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

- The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
- Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:
- To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))
```

- List items can be of any data type:
- A list can contain different data types:
``` list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"] ```

- From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':
- It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.

```
thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thislist)
```
- There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
- List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
- Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
- *Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.

- You can access list items by referring to the index number
- Negative indexing means start from the end
- -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.
- You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.
- When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.

- To determine if a specified item is present in a list use the in keyword:
---
### Python - Change List Items

- To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:
- To change the value of items within a specific range, define a list with the new values, and refer to the range of index numbers where you want to insert the new values:
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
print(thislist)
```

```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "mango"]
thislist[1:3] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist)
```

- If you insert more items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1:2] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist)
```

- If you insert less items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1:3] = ["watermelon"]
print(thislist)
```

- The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(2, "watermelon")
print(thislist)
```

### Python - Add List Items

- To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.append("orange")
print(thislist)
```

- To append elements from another list to the current list, use the extend() method.
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
tropical = ["mango", "pineapple", "papaya"]
thislist.extend(tropical)
print(thislist)
```

- The extend() method does not have to append lists, you can add any iterable object (tuples, sets, dictionaries etc.).
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thistuple = ("kiwi", "orange")
thislist.extend(thistuple)
print(thislist)
```
--- 
### Python - Remove List Items

- The remove() method removes the specified item.
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.remove("banana")
print(thislist)
```

- If there are more than one item with the specified value, the remove() method removes the first occurrence:
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "banana", "kiwi"]
thislist.remove("banana")
print(thislist)
```

- The pop() method removes the specified index.
- If you do not specify the index, the pop() method removes the last item.
- The del keyword also removes the specified index:
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
del thislist[0]
print(thislist)
```
- The del keyword can also delete the list completely.
- The clear() method empties the list. The list still remains, but it has no content.
---
### Python - Loop Lists

- You can loop through the list items by using a for loop:
- You can also loop through the list items by referring to their index number. Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
  print(thislist[i])
```

- You can loop through the list items by using a while loop.
- Use the len() function to determine the length of the list, then start at 0 and loop your way through the list items by referring to their indexes.
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
while i < len(thislist):
  print(thislist[i])
  i = i + 1
```

- List Comprehension offers the shortest syntax for looping through lists:
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
[print(x) for x in thislist]
```

---

### List Comprehension

- List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.
- Syntax for List Comprehension
``` newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True] ```

- The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that evaluate to True.
- You can use a range function for the iterable and with the condition
```newlist = [x for x in range(10) if x < 5]```

- The expression is the current item in the iteration, but it is also the outcome, which you can manipulate before it ends up like a list item in the new list:
```newlist = [x.upper() for x in fruits]```
