## Python Sets

- Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
- A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
- Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)
```
- Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
- Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
- Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
- Duplicates not allowed. Sets cannot have two items with the same value.
- The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:
- The values False and 0 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:
- To determine how many items a set has, use the len() function.

```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(len(thisset))

output - 3
```

- Set items can be of any data type:

```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 3}
set3 = {True, False, False}
```

- A set can contain different data types:
- From Python's perspective, sets are defined as objects with the data type 'set':

```
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(type(myset))

Output - <class 'set'>
```

- It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set.
```
thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thisset)

Output - {'banana', 'cherry', 'apple'}
```

- List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
- Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

### Python - Access Set Items

- You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.
- But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.

```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for x in thisset:
  print(x)
```

- Using in keyword in sets, The output is a boolean value, True or False
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print("banana" in thisset)
```

- We also have a same which is not in
- Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.
---

### Python - Add Set Items

- Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items. To add one item to a set use the add() method.

```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
thisset.add("orange")
print(thisset)

Output - {'orange', 'banana', 'cherry', 'apple'}
```

- To add items from another set into the current set, use the update() method.
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
tropical = {"pineapple", "mango", "papaya"}
thisset.update(tropical)
print(thisset)

Output - {'apple', 'mango', 'cherry', 'pineapple', 'banana', 'papaya'}
```

- The object in the update() method does not have to be a set, it can be any iterable object (tuples, lists, dictionaries etc.).
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
mylist = ["kiwi", "orange"]
thisset.update(mylist)
print(thisset)
```
---

### Remove Set Items

- To remove an item in a set, use the remove(), or the discard() method.
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
thisset.remove("banana")
print(thisset)
```

- If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error.
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
thisset.discard("banana")
print(thisset)
```

- If the item to remove does not exist, discard() will NOT raise an error.
- You can also use the pop() method to remove an item, but this method will remove a random item, so you cannot be sure what item that gets removed.
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
x = thisset.pop()
print(x)
print(thisset)

Output - 
cherry
{'banana', 'apple'}
```

- The clear() method empties the set:
- The del keyword will delete the set completely:

---

### Loop Sets

- You can loop through the set items by using a for loop:

```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for x in thisset:
  print(x)
```
---

### Join Sets

- There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python
- The union() and update() methods joins all items from both sets.
- The intersection() method keeps ONLY the duplicates.
- The difference() method keeps the items from the first set that are not in the other set(s).
- The symmetric_difference() method keeps all items EXCEPT the duplicates.

- The union() method returns a new set with all items from both sets.
```
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)

Output - {'b', 'c', 3, 1, 'a', 2}
```
- You can use the | operator instead of the union() method, and you will get the same result.
- All the joining methods and operators can be used to join multiple sets.
- When using a method, just add more sets in the parentheses, separated by commas:
```
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = {"John", "Elena"}
set4 = {"apple", "bananas", "cherry"}

myset = set1.union(set2, set3, set4)
print(myset)
```

- When using the | operator, separate the sets with more | operators:
```
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = {"John", "Elena"}
set4 = {"apple", "bananas", "cherry"}

myset = set1 | set2 | set3 |set4
print(myset)
```

- The union() method allows you to join a set with other data types, like lists or tuples. The result will be a set.

```
x = {"a", "b", "c"}
y = (1, 2, 3)

z = x.union(y)
print(z)
```

- The  | operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the  union() method.

---
- The update() method inserts all items from one set into another. The update() changes the original set, and does not return a new set.

```
set1 = {"a", "b" , "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set1.update(set2)
print(set1)
```

- Both union() and update() will exclude any duplicate items.

- Keep ONLY the duplicates. The intersection() method will return a new set, that only contains the items that are present in both sets.

```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1.intersection(set2)
print(set3)
```

- You can use the & operator instead of the intersection() method, and you will get the same result.

```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1 & set2
print(set3)
```

- The & operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the intersection() method.
- The intersection_update() method will also keep ONLY the duplicates, but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.

```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set1.intersection_update(set2)

print(set1)
```
- The values True and 1 are considered the same value. The same goes for False and 0.

```
set1 = {"apple", 1,  "banana", 0, "cherry"}
set2 = {False, "google", 1, "apple", 2, True}

set3 = set1.intersection(set2)

print(set3)
```

- The difference() method will return a new set that will contain only the items from the first set that are not present in the other set.
```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1.difference(set2)

print(set3)

Output - {'banana', 'cherry'}
```
- You can use the - operator instead of the difference() method, and you will get the same result.
```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1 - set2
print(set3)
```

- The - operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the difference() method.
- The difference_update() method will also keep the items from the first set that are not in the other set, but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.

```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set1.difference_update(set2)

print(set1)
```

- The symmetric_difference() method will keep only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.
```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)

print(set3)
```

- You can use the ^ operator instead of the symmetric_difference() method, and you will get the same result.

```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1 ^ set2
print(set3)
```

- The ^ operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the symmetric_difference() method.
- The symmetric_difference_update() method will also keep all but the duplicates, but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.

```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set1.symmetric_difference_update(set2)

print(set1)
```
