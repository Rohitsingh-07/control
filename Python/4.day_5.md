## Python Sets

- Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
- A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
- Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)
```
- Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
- Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
