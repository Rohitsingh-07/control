1. What is a Server?
In computer science, a **server** is a computer or system that provides services, resources, or data to other computers, known as **clients**, over a network. Servers are designed to handle multiple client requests simultaneously and efficiently.

### **Types of Servers**
1. **Web Server** – Hosts websites and serves web pages to users via HTTP/HTTPS (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
2. **Database Server** – Manages databases and responds to queries (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3. **File Server** – Stores and manages files for clients (e.g., Windows Server, NAS devices).
4. **Application Server** – Hosts and runs applications (e.g., Tomcat, JBoss).
5. **Mail Server** – Manages and delivers emails (e.g., Microsoft Exchange, Postfix).
6. **DNS Server** – Resolves domain names to IP addresses (e.g., BIND, Cloudflare DNS).
7. **Proxy Server** – Acts as an intermediary between clients and other servers for security or caching (e.g., Squid, HAProxy).

### **How Servers Work**
1. **Client Requests** – A client (e.g., a web browser) sends a request to the server.
2. **Processing** – The server processes the request, retrieves data, or performs computations.
3. **Response** – The server sends back the requested data or service.

Servers can be physical hardware (on-premises) or virtual (cloud-based), and they often run specialized server operating systems like **Windows Server** or **Linux distributions** (Ubuntu Server, CentOS).
