We are learning about the tool AIMS Grid 

AIMS Grid
Aims Grid has four components 
1. Purpose
2. Stakeholders
3. End Result
4. Success Criteria

A youtube vide which explains AIMS Grid in a much more better way - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6118I9HViuQ

We are using the Sales Management System which stores the data from the sales invoice and then we use Mysql to store it and Mysql will be the tool which will be used for the ETL process.

OLTP - Online Transaction Processing system

So mysql is the oltp where the data from the sales invoices gets stored. Since oltp is the Online Transaction Processing System it stores the data and then we perform ETL on mysql and store it in some kind of Dataa Warehouse 
such as Terra data, Snowflake, etc

The reason to use the Data Warehouse is because if we directly query on the mysql data, it can slow it down since it is processing the query to fetch the data. Also the format of the data that is stored in the OLTP 
is not much readable and may have certain columns which is not that needed for our utilisation.

Data Engineers perform the ETL process and maintain the Data Warehouse infrastructure.

We are going to plug the Olap with the data visualisation tool and then get the visualisation started

We started learning about the SQL. Started and set up the Mysql workbench and connected a dataset and running queries on that.
- There is also a course on Khan academy about the relational databases

So Once we install the Power BI, we are goint to pull the data in the Power BI do the required ETL and create a dashboard around it
