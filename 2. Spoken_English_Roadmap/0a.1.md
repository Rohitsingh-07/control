# 🔊 CUSTOM ACCENT GUIDE FOR YOU

Because you like actor-like speech, focus on:

### **1. Intonation**

Actors use:

Then fast → comedic

Master both.

### **3. Connected Speech**

This will fix your fumbling:

**Examples:**

* “Did you” → “didja”
* “What are you doing?” → “whaddaya doin”
* “I don’t know” → “ionno”

### **4. Fix These Indian-Speaker Issues**

* Flat intonation
* Hard T everywhere
* Over-enunciated R
* Speaking too fast in chunks
