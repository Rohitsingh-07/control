1. Create a new file and write to it
2. Reading file line by line
3. File open modes
4. With statement

- Open is used to open a given path and the file. The first parameter is the file name and the second parameter is the mode such as write or read
- .write() function is used to write to the file
- .close() function is used to close the file
- w is write which overwrites what we write in a file
- a is append which appends to the given file whatever we want to write
- \n is a new line character which will append the line to a new line
- file.read() is used to read all the contents of the file
- Always close the file
- .split() function is used to split a given line with separators and the output of split is a list of tokens
- with statement is used so that even if we forget to close the file after use, it won't cause any issue

EXCEPTION HANDLING

- Exception Handling is done in python by using Try Catch which has statement as Try Except

A small progrm showing the try except thing
'''
x=input("Enter number 1: ")
y=input("Enter number 2: ")
try:
    z=int(x)/int(y)
except:
    print('Cannot Perform Maths')
'''

- We can also do multiple exception where we use except more than once to handle more than one case
