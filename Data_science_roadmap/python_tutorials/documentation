1. Starting to learn the python first 16 videos which will give a small overview

Variables - These are containers that can hold any kind of data

to round the float numbers to a given limit we can use rounf(variable,2) to reduce it to two decimal points

Strings are used to store text data in python

For SLicing in python we use []
Strings are immutable, we cannot change any position in string once it is defined
- We can use ''' ''' for multi line strings
- \n means a new line
- str() is a function which is used to convert any other data type to string

LISTS
- Lists are mutable
- Slicing works in Lists
- .append() function in lists append the value in the list at the end position
- .insert() function in lists insert the value in the list at a specified position and we have to specify the index where we want that value to be
- If we want to combine two lists, we just need to add them with the '+' sign
- len() function tells us about the number of characters or values in a given list or variable
- To do look up in lists we can use the 'in' operator which will help us to know whether that value or item in present in a given list or not. The resultant data type of the 'in' oprator is a Bool

PYCHARM
- This is an IDE just like any other IDE that is used to run huge oython file and execute it
- In pycharm or other IDEs we have the functionality of a breakpoint which will execute the code only till that given line and can help to identify and bugs present without much of a hassle

A small program to check whether the number is even or odd using input() function.

num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
if num%2 == 0: print('Number is Even')
else: print('Number is Odd')

We checked the different types of operators that are used such as AND, OR

A small program to identify the cuisine of a given dish

indian = ['samosa','daal','naan']
chinese = ['egg role','pot sticker', 'fried rice']
italian = ['pizza','pasta','risotto']

dish=input('Enter a dish name: ')

if dish in indian: print('indian')
elif dish in chinese: print('chinese')
elif dish in italian: print('italian')
else: print('Based on the knowledge I have, I dont know which cuisine is', dish)

Loops and Of comes under the control flow
