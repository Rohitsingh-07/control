1. Starting to learn the python first 16 videos which will give a small overview

Variables - These are containers that can hold any kind of data

to round the float numbers to a given limit we can use rounf(variable,2) to reduce it to two decimal points

Strings are used to store text data in python

For SLicing in python we use []
Strings are immutable, we cannot change any position in string once it is defined
- We can use ''' ''' for multi line strings
- \n means a new line
- str() is a function which is used to convert any other data type to string

LISTS
- Lists are mutable
- Slicing works in Lists
- .append() function in lists append the value in the list at the end position
- .insert() function in lists insert the value in the list at a specified position and we have to specify the index where we want that value to be
- If we want to combine two lists, we just need to add them with the '+' sign
- len() function tells us about the number of characters or values in a given list or variable
- To do look up in lists we can use the 'in' operator which will help us to know whether that value or item in present in a given list or not. The resultant data type of the 'in' oprator is a Bool

PYCHARM
- This is an IDE just like any other IDE that is used to run huge oython file and execute it
- In pycharm or other IDEs we have the functionality of a breakpoint which will execute the code only till that given line and can help to identify and bugs present without much of a hassle
