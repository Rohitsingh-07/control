- In numpy arrays we can create single dimensional and multidimensional arrays

a = np.array([5,6,9]) # this is a single dimensional array
a[0]                  # we can access the elements of an array using the index

a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]])  # this is a multidimensional array
a.ndim                             # ndim is used to know the number of dimensions of a numpy array

a.dtype                            # this is used to identify the data type of the elements present in the numpy array
a.itemsize                         # this is used to get the size of the elements in bytes. This will tell the size of the single element and all the elements are of same datatype

a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], dtype=np.float64) # this line of code can be used to change th datatype of the elements in the given numpy array

a.size # this will tell the total number of elements present in the given array

a.shape # this will tell the shape of the array which consists of the (no of rows, no of columns) structure

np.zeros((3,4)) # this will create an array with zeros as all the elements for the given shape

# the same thing can be done with ones with np.ones((3,4))
