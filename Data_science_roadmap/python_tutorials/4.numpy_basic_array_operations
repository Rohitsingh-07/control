- In numpy arrays we can create single dimensional and multidimensional arrays

a = np.array([5,6,9]) # this is a single dimensional array
a[0]                  # we can access the elements of an array using the index

a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]])  # this is a multidimensional array
a.ndim                             # ndim is used to know the number of dimensions of a numpy array

a.dtype                            # this is used to identify the data type of the elements present in the numpy array
a.itemsize                         # this is used to get the size of the elements in bytes. This will tell the size of the single element and all the elements are of same datatype

a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], dtype=np.float64) # this line of code can be used to change th datatype of the elements in the given numpy array

a.size # this will tell the total number of elements present in the given array

a.shape # this will tell the shape of the array which consists of the (no of rows, no of columns) structure

np.zeros((3,4)) # this will create an array with zeros as all the elements for the given shape

# the same thing can be done with ones with np.ones((3,4))

- range() and arange are two functions in numpy which create a list which contains the elements between a start point and an end point which are basically numbers
- range creates a list whereas arange creates a numpy array and arange is the only one which is a numpy function
- np arange function also has the step with it. so it would create the array of the numbers with a step of it
- np.linspace function is another function in numpy which creates an array which has the start point, end point and the step. So here the step is used to linearly split the number in the given no of steps
- It will keep the difference between two numbers similar but will break it in a linear pattern

- reshape is another function in numpy which is used to change the shape of a given array be it the shape is compatible with the no of elements present
- ravel is another function in numpy which is used to flatten the array in a single dimensional one. It is used to convert a multi dimensional array into a single one
- The above mentioned functions would not change the nature of the original array so we need to keep that in mind while doing any data manipulations

- axis 0 in numpy array means the columns and axis 1 in numpy array means the rows
- np.sqrt() is a function which will return the square root of the given elements of the array
