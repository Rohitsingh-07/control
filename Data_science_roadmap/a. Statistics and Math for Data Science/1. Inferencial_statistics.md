# What Is Inferential Statistics?
Inferential statistics is the practice of using sampled data to draw conclusions or make predictions about a larger sample data sample or population.

Inferential statistics help us draw conclusions about how a hypothesis will play out or to determine a general parameter about a larger sample. We often use this process to compare two groups of subjects to make greater generalizations about a larger overall population.
