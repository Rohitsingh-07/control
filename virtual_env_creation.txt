What are the advantages of Virtual Environment in Python?

1. Isolation: Virtual environments provide a isolated environment for each project, preventing dependency conflicts. 
2. Portability: Virtual environments are portable, allowing you to move projects between systems without worrying about dependencies.

How to create a Virtual environment in Python?
- Open up the CMD
- Go to the folder that you want to create the virtual environment ( In our case we did it on the Desktop)
- run the command python -m venv env(env here is the environemt's name that we can keep anything)
- after creating the virtual env we need to activate it with this command - "env\Scripts\activate.bat"
- cls is the command to clear the screen in command prompt
- To deactivate the virtual env we just have to run "deactivate" in the command prompt and the virtual env will get deactivated
- We can now install packages into the given  V env to run the given code as we want to
- PIP stands for Prefferred Installer Program
- pip list will show us the packages present in the env

- Do also learn how to install packages from a file

How do I start coding in the virtual environment?
- Just write "code" in the command prompt and then the VS code gets started where you can start writing the code

- We can write a list of requirements of the libraries in python in a file by pip list> requirements.txt this will have the libraries in this text file
- to install all the librares in the requirements file we have to write pip install - r requirements.txt
