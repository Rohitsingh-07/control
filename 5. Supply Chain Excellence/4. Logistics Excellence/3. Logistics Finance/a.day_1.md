## Customer Financing

- Now, let's talk about customer financing. What I mean by that is would you join a customer supply chain finance program? I'll focus on both the benefits and the threats of this decision, but let me first preface all of this by saying that in a lot of situations we are going to suppliers and we're trying to provide financing to them. So you have a buyer and they are going to try to get you into their program because they have a benefit. The interesting thing about it is that different companies might approach it differently. So as a couple of years ago, I'll tell you this quick story where I had the owner of a company in to speak to a group and they had two large customers and one of them had a supply chain finance program versus the other one who didn't. The supply chain finance program was so successful for them that it changed the way they looked at their customers and which customer they're going to work with more closely going forward.
- These types of stories happen and you also have stories where companies have approach their suppliers in not a very good way and it was perceived as very negative to join a supply chain finance program. So a lot of the supplier management is where it becomes very real in terms of whether supply chain finance program is successful. So alternatives would be you maintain your original payment term, you basically say, no, I'm not participating in anything or you could just wait for the payment in full and you're getting money when you get it or to find a new customer. Depending on important size and other consideration, you might have options there. You might be able to tell your customer that no, you will pay me within 30 days, no alternatives, or you say I'll walk away I'm not doing business with you again, those are all options, but sometimes you may not have those alternatives so either you participate or you wait for the payment in full.

## Benefits of Customer Financing

<img width="1919" height="957" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d19dee07-7293-42a4-ba1d-aeef198f28c7" />

<img width="1919" height="949" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9537b960-8a0a-4671-9281-d5b8e61676cb" />

- Let's talk about the benefits of customer financing. Well, one is liquidity. You might have access to additional capital, you might have benefits in terms of getting that capital at a lower cost, and if you're in a situation where your bank is restricting the amount of lending they want to do with you and/or you can't necessarily get additional banking relationships, this could be very powerful, this could be a very important source of liquidity, and it's not going to cost you a lot, so it can be a very beneficial thing. The other one is typically when companies are joining or setting up supply chain finance program, whoever's providing that service is going to implement a certain amount of payment disciplines. So no matter what, if an invoice has been approved, they will deduct the payment and send it on the date that is indicated on the invoice, so you're not going to have any more late payments. There was a story, when some companies were asked to join in supply chain finance programs, their response quickly was that, "Yeah, payment extension to 90 days is not even that big of a deal." Because even though before they had 60-day payment terms, for example, nobody paid in 60 days. So it's more often than you think that companies are not paying the bills on time.

## Threats Of Customer Financing

<img width="1919" height="986" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/badb6296-5620-47a4-bf4e-923454a655a8" />

- Let us talk also about the threats of customer financing. So what could happen? Well, one has to do with, if you don't necessarily want to participate, that could give your customer an indication that you're not necessarily committed to the relationship, and they're going to reduce their purchases from you in the future and well, you'll make less money. The other one is a little bit more trickier because if you agree to join a supply chain finance program, you're making it significantly easier for the customer to increase their payment terms in the future. So if the first step was to go between 60 and 90 days, then going to 105 or 120, this is fairly easy because you already agreed to 90 and you're getting used to this. It's not necessarily something that is going to hurt you on the supply chain finance program. So that could be one of the drawbacks.
- The other thing that some people are talking about sometimes is that well, you are going to get a cost increase. In other words, if they put you on a supply chain finance program and it typically takes away half a percent of your invoice, next time around when it comes to increasing prices, you're just going to increase your price. I would be careful with that one because that may not go over very well with your customer. For one, they are going to notice it and unless you are very sure that it's not going to damage the relationship going forward, that can also blow back. So be careful with that one.

## The Other side of DPO

<img width="1919" height="997" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/570b0009-c0dd-44dd-9f60-fbd4bd409415" />

- Now let's talk about the other side of DPO extension and that has to do with, you have different suppliers and not every supplier is necessarily the same. You have strategic supplier and those are going to be very important to your success going forward. You want to treat them carefully and maintain a positive long-term relationship with us. Then the bottleneck suppliers which are very risky. They are not easy to replace, typically. Then you also have leverage suppliers where there's a big potentials to add value either in terms of revenue increases or cost reductions. Since we're talking about suppliers typically, the value is delivered in terms of cost reductions.

<img width="1919" height="955" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/425707f9-31b8-4a96-a316-8d245e59da79" />

- They might be a large part of your costs, so you definitely can make big advances in terms of your bottom line there. Lastly, you have routine suppliers where the most you want to accomplish is typically to reduce complexity, have an easy relationship. They are not companies you buy from a lot, but there are a lot of routine suppliers and you want to make it as seamless as possible. So when we think about extending our payables in general, the question is which category do we go towards? Obviously, they shouldn't all be treated the same. The other thing is, when we're trying to extend payables, where is our initiative going to have the biggest return? Well, when we look at these four categories of suppliers, and I just put up some numbers and they may vary by company, but typically, routine supplier is by far the most number of suppliers.
- Second largest group is typically leverage, and then strategic, and lastly, bottleneck. Bottleneck suppliers are hopefully a very small percentage of your overall suppliers. But again, those are the risky ones. When we look at how much money we spend with these different categories, your largest category is strategic suppliers, then followed by leverage, then followed by routine, and lastly, bottleneck suppliers. Typically, it's in that order. So if you have an initiative based on leverage suppliers, okay, that's going to cover 30 percent of your spend. It might be pretty good.
- But if you don't have strategic suppliers, that's not necessarily going to be the ball, even the majority of your suppliers. So you want to manage the segments carefully and think about where am I going to maintain the relationship, especially with strategic suppliers, and where am I going to really move DPO? Because ultimately, it's going to be an average number and not everything is going to work out equally. Typically, a lot of banks that run supply chain finance programs say they want to implement their program with the top 50 largest suppliers, because that typically covers 50 percent of a company spent.

## Customer Objectives

<img width="1919" height="935" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2d28bbd-686e-47a3-8f3c-01d075b7da95" />

- So now let's talk about the objectives that a customer would have when dealing with suppliers. And depending if you find yourself in the supplier situation, knowing in which category you would be it's going to tell you something about what they're trying to do. So strategic suppliers, typically you're profitable. You are unique and critical to their competitive advantage. Sometimes you help them develop new products. And for your customer, their objective is to maximize performance and manage the relationship closely. It goes beyond just cost.
- Bottleneck suppliers, you might have quality issues or regulatory challenges. And they might have few alternatives to you. Your customer is going to want to remove risk and vulnerability. And make sure the quality and continuity of supply is ensured. With leverage supplier you're typically the best value provider. But your customer's also very responsive to price. There might be some uniqueness, but typically it's a price game.
- They're going to try to continuously drive cost savings and put you against other suppliers in this category. So you're most likely not the only choice, so you have to be very careful. If you don't keep your customer happy, your market share could go to somebody else. And then lastly routine suppliers. They typically don't add value, easy to replace. There's a lot of competitive pressures. It's something that you can get anywhere.
- And your customer's going to want to remove complexity and make it as simple as possible to manage the relationship. So with that, you have to think about where is the best place to implement that supply chain. Finance program or a card program or something else?

## How to React?

<img width="1919" height="939" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a81281dc-453b-408b-ad83-5a7b5cf28daf" />

- So how do you react when a customer tells you they want to, for example, implement a supply chain finance program? Well, it depends on the category that you're in. If you're a strategic supplier, maybe the supply chain finance program can be positioned as a win-win, and then it might be okay. Changing of payment terms might be perceived as negative. So if they approach you with only the goal of increasing payment terms, well, that's going to give you an idea about the relationship they want. But typically, you have to see how the whole program works out. It might be a win for you as well.

<img width="1919" height="956" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d375235-49af-4ae5-9b91-47347174a0d3" />

- If you're at 60 days, and now they can pay you 50 days faster, maybe that's the angle, and you have to act accordingly. For a bottleneck supplier, if you know that you're in that category. Maybe you're in a shaky financial situation, and now they try to pay you later. That's going to be very tricky, and it might add additional cost to you, so you might not be as amenable to it. But if it is consistency of payment, it might actually have a positive effect on you, so it depends. For a leverage supplier, you might be able to provide your customer with additional value by joining their program. Because now they can extend their payables, increase their cash holdings.

<img width="1919" height="946" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/177d8849-f920-4245-94be-06f25aacf6fc" />

<img width="1919" height="958" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/965aacc8-2b61-429b-a112-cc8be81d837c" />

- And in addition, they might actually want a lower price for that faster payment. They might actually say, well, yeah, you pay a half a percent off of the invoice, but I pay you so fast, you should give me additional discount. So it could actually even go that way. And finally, for a routine supplier, most likely, your customer might approach you with a credit card program. Because it simplifies the payment process for them, and it can just streamline the way they do business with you. And these additional costs might be offset by faster payment. So it might be okay to accept that credit card.
