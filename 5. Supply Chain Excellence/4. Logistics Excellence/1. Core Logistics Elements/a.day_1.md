- All right now it's time to talk about Outbound product flow. We'll start with a different delivery options, the different options for transportation. So I'm basically looking at four different categories and this case which will be the appropriate method for the vast majority of products. I generally think most products will be shipped either via road, via rail, via air or via ocean. When it comes to transportation within a country, or within a continent, and it's typically roadway or air and ocean is obviously as the name implies, mostly for international products across continents. There also pipelines and so on, but those are more specialized ways of transporting products. Now, within those different categories, each mode of transportation has their advantages and disadvantages and in this lesson we'll basically cover each one of these four methods in some detail and look at when they should be used and for what and what their advantages and disadvantages are.

## The Real Impact of High Transportation Costs

By Dawn Russell, John J. Coyle, Kusumal Ruamsook and Evelyn A. Thomchick 

High  transportation costs are driving three main shifts in supply chain  strategies. These changes are having a beneficial impact not just on  transportation budgets but also on broader supply chain and financial  performance. This article was written by some of the top experts on transportation and one of the founders of the logistics discipline (John Coyle)

## Road Transport

- All right, let's talk about road transport. The main benefits of transporting goods on the road and trucks are cost. It's a fairly price conscious way of moving products. Speed, it's one of the fastest modes, especially on shorter distances, and accessibility. As long as there's a road, because sometimes when there's no road, a truck will be able to make it there unlike other modes of transportation. So when would you use road transport? Most products at some point in their journey are moving on the road.

- So that means that it's not necessarily something that most shippers are going to avoid in the first place, it is just out of necessity. But then the question is why don't we just put it all on a truck, and that might be a good option. So at the end of the journey typically the final delivery is on the road. One of the big advantages trucks can typically meet very precise schedules, and you can tell a delivery vehicle to be there at a certain time and most of the time they're very close to that. And on the road you also have that flexibility. The roads are always open typically, and you're not bound to some other factors that are going to restrict when that product can be delivered.

## Rail Transport

- Now let's talk about rail transport. Big advantages for a rail is one, the cost. Especially for large and heavy items, putting them on a train is going to be a lot cheaper than putting them on a truck. That benefit is not necessarily going to be there on smaller items or items that are very light but on heavy items, it's definitely a big advantage. So the cost can be one of the drivers of using rail. The other one is capacity. You can put very large items on a rail car that might otherwise have difficulties going on a truck, partly due to size restrictions.
- Truck sometimes have more limited things that you can put on them because you can still accomplish larger items on a truck, but you're not necessarily, it's not going to be easy. So sometimes you see large products moving on the road and they have to clear the road and have to make sure that the height is okay and all of that. So that's a big production and that obviously also increase the cost. If it fits with a new standard rail flatbed car, then it's not that big of a problem. And the last reason to use rail is its efficiency. If we're looking at CO2 emissions, rail is typically 40 times more efficient from a fuel perspective than a truck even though we're making advances in technology and trucking. But rail will always be much more efficient than trucking In terms of fuel consumption.
- Now that translates into price also but a lot of companies look at benefits specifically from an environmental perspective. So it's in that [INAUDIBLE], switching some parts of the journey over to rail would be very beneficial. So when would you use rail transportation? Bulk items are typically moved via rail. If you have coal or if you have things that are heavy. Oil is often moved on a train if there's no specific pipeline or just in general larger items, rail's pricing is going to be more beneficial if you're moving heavy items. It's also a very popular sustainable option because of the fuel efficiency of rail.
- And in many cases when you say you're using rail, it really means that it's intermodal. So the beginning and the end of the journey are done via truck and the middle of the journey, most likely the longest piece in the largest part of the journey is going to be done on rail. And if those schedules can be aligned fairly well, then it's going to actually provide you with most of the benefits of both methods at the least amount of cost.
