## Overview of Delivery Options

<img width="1919" height="944" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aedf2c4-421f-431d-9751-14bef36693ad" />

- All right now it's time to talk about Outbound product flow. We'll start with a different delivery options, the different options for transportation. So I'm basically looking at four different categories and this case which will be the appropriate method for the vast majority of products. I generally think most products will be shipped either via road, via rail, via air or via ocean. When it comes to transportation within a country, or within a continent, and it's typically roadway or air and ocean is obviously as the name implies, mostly for international products across continents. There also pipelines and so on, but those are more specialized ways of transporting products. Now, within those different categories, each mode of transportation has their advantages and disadvantages and in this lesson we'll basically cover each one of these four methods in some detail and look at when they should be used and for what and what their advantages and disadvantages are.

## The Real Impact of High Transportation Costs

By Dawn Russell, John J. Coyle, Kusumal Ruamsook and Evelyn A. Thomchick 

High  transportation costs are driving three main shifts in supply chain  strategies. These changes are having a beneficial impact not just on  transportation budgets but also on broader supply chain and financial  performance. This article was written by some of the top experts on transportation and one of the founders of the logistics discipline (John Coyle)

## Road Transport

<img width="1916" height="934" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb7eab66-89f3-456f-af40-9587c60103eb" />

- All right, let's talk about road transport. The main benefits of transporting goods on the road and trucks are cost. It's a fairly price conscious way of moving products. Speed, it's one of the fastest modes, especially on shorter distances, and accessibility. As long as there's a road, because sometimes when there's no road, a truck will be able to make it there unlike other modes of transportation. So when would you use road transport? Most products at some point in their journey are moving on the road.

<img width="1919" height="945" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b1421c7-6472-404f-bd81-cd7070628e35" />

- So that means that it's not necessarily something that most shippers are going to avoid in the first place, it is just out of necessity. But then the question is why don't we just put it all on a truck, and that might be a good option. So at the end of the journey typically the final delivery is on the road. One of the big advantages trucks can typically meet very precise schedules, and you can tell a delivery vehicle to be there at a certain time and most of the time they're very close to that. And on the road you also have that flexibility. The roads are always open typically, and you're not bound to some other factors that are going to restrict when that product can be delivered.

## Rail Transport

<img width="1912" height="944" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a079aa7f-69db-4d45-947f-b2abee82621e" />

- Now let's talk about rail transport. Big advantages for a rail is one, the cost. Especially for large and heavy items, putting them on a train is going to be a lot cheaper than putting them on a truck. That benefit is not necessarily going to be there on smaller items or items that are very light but on heavy items, it's definitely a big advantage. So the cost can be one of the drivers of using rail. The other one is capacity. You can put very large items on a rail car that might otherwise have difficulties going on a truck, partly due to size restrictions.
- Truck sometimes have more limited things that you can put on them because you can still accomplish larger items on a truck, but you're not necessarily, it's not going to be easy. So sometimes you see large products moving on the road and they have to clear the road and have to make sure that the height is okay and all of that. So that's a big production and that obviously also increase the cost. If it fits with a new standard rail flatbed car, then it's not that big of a problem. And the last reason to use rail is its efficiency. If we're looking at CO2 emissions, rail is typically 40 times more efficient from a fuel perspective than a truck even though we're making advances in technology and trucking. But rail will always be much more efficient than trucking In terms of fuel consumption.
- Now that translates into price also but a lot of companies look at benefits specifically from an environmental perspective. So it's in that [INAUDIBLE], switching some parts of the journey over to rail would be very beneficial. So when would you use rail transportation? Bulk items are typically moved via rail. If you have coal or if you have things that are heavy. Oil is often moved on a train if there's no specific pipeline or just in general larger items, rail's pricing is going to be more beneficial if you're moving heavy items. It's also a very popular sustainable option because of the fuel efficiency of rail.
- And in many cases when you say you're using rail, it really means that it's intermodal. So the beginning and the end of the journey are done via truck and the middle of the journey, most likely the longest piece in the largest part of the journey is going to be done on rail. And if those schedules can be aligned fairly well, then it's going to actually provide you with most of the benefits of both methods at the least amount of cost.

<img width="1919" height="953" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/462c77fe-6f2b-4888-bfb2-ecce75fca2d4" />

## Air Transport

<img width="1919" height="949" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b91d6646-a35d-497d-9a0d-4f92546a8b06" />

- Now let's talk about air transport. The main benefits for air transport is its speed. You can move products at a much higher speed than with any other mode of course. I put a speed in there twice because that is by far it's biggest advantage. If you have things that have to be there at a certain time. If he can fly them over that is especially over large distance going to be by far the fastest way. Now that speed advantage is going to diminish and shorter journeys.
- So on journeys of less than 500 miles, typically truck will be faster because the time you get to the airport, loaded on a plane, the plane takes off on a certain schedule and so on, the truck will have made most of that journey already. So over short distances, that speed advantage is not necessarily there over tracking. However, on longer journeys, it's definitely something that is there. The third benefit of air transport is that it's a very gentle mode of transportation. Typically very low turbulence, so you can have very sensitive type of products, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and so on. On a plane there's a great degree of control over the state that product is on its journey, so you don't have to worry about products getting damaged that often with air transport. So when would you use air transport.

<img width="1919" height="941" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/464edb83-7240-4040-8630-f2c063c1ebf6" />

- When the cost of transportation is a tiny fraction of the overall cost of the products, that's when it's very easy to make that decision to just use air transport. Also when speed is essential, as I mentioned before, and electronics and pharmaceuticals are some of the best examples for air transport. They're typically smaller items, they're very expensive, typically very light, and the overall cost of the product. These are expensive products. So a very small portion of the overall cost.

## Ocean Transport

<img width="1919" height="946" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67f74334-54b2-41e0-a0db-196bfadfebab" />

- Now let's talk about ocean transport. The big benefits of ocean transport, one is you don't necessarily have a choice if you going across oceans because the only other option would be air transport, and most products are not going to be cost efficient in the air. So that's your only choice with most international goods. But within that, the cost of moving products across the ocean is very cheap actually, because ships nowadays are quite efficient at moving products, and they also have tremendous capacity. Most of the freight is containerized. But ships are so large, they can accommodate all kinds of different shapes and sizes. So it's a very popular method and as global trade expands over time, ocean transport expands with it, and then there's lots of different shipping lanes, and options, and schedules that companies can take advantage of.

<img width="1918" height="944" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51cac17b-0ffa-42da-9a2b-6ca8aa250f0f" />

- The main uses as I mentioned, transcontinental, where the only other option is air, ocean is by magnitudes cheaper. Unless you can afford air, you'll probably use ocean as the default. Obviously, most of the time, you'll have to have truck probably, at least truck at the origin and at the destination. Sometimes they're products if let's say they come from Asia to the US, they use truck, inland in Asia to the port, then the container goes on an ocean ship, then the ship goes over to the United States for example, gets offloaded. Sometimes they actually put it on rail for part of its journey, and then the last step into delivery is to move it via truck. So it hits multiple modes within one journey. So ocean is one of those critical linkages of global trade.

## State of Logistics Report

While last year’s report highlighted the need to get back in sync,  the 2023 version focuses on how logistics operations can build long-term  resilience in an effort to best serve customers through a variety of  distribution channels.  Among the notable findings:

A key report statistic, U.S. business logistics costs, shows an increase.  USBLC now stands at a record $2.3 trillion (was $1.85 trillion last  year), representing 9.1% of national GDP—the highest percentage of GDP  ever.

While consumers are continuing to return to stores, e-commerce sales are not slowing down.  In 2022, the U.S. e-commerce market grew by 8%, to $1.03 trillion (was  $871 billion). It is now 14.5% of the entire U.S. retail market.

Third-party logistics providers are investing more  capital into their technology offerings, as opposed to shippers  (companies that provide goods and services). Respondents  indicated that 96% of 3PLs have migrated to the cloud (shippers  indicated 86% of them have), while 80% of 3PLs are investing in IoT (77%  for shippers).

The reshoring movement continues. For a number  of businesses, reshoring has gone from a strategic possibility to a  market reality. According to the Kearney Reshoring Index, American  imports of Mexican manufactured goods have grown by 26% (dating back to  spring 2020).

## Purpose of a Logistics Network

<img width="1919" height="946" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39e82673-124c-49cc-beca-d6c68738e4dc" />

- Now let's talk about the logistics network. And a logistics network is defined as having really two parts to it that connect the manufacturing facility to customers. So you have transportation lanes and those are the lines between the boxes that you see, and warehouses. And in most cases, companies will use multiple warehouses, each focusing on specific sets of customers or regions of customer, and then transportation lanes to connect them. And the reason why you do it that way is because let's say, you have manufacturing. So as you build all these products, if you ship them directly to each customer, it's going to be rather small quantities and you need to store a lot of items right near your manufacturing facility. You move them forward, you're going to have a very efficient way of transporting these goods.
- Let's say, use truckload transportation. So you rent a full truck to warehouse A, for example, and that's where you store your item. As soon as they're manufacturers, they can move to either to warehouse A or warehouse B. That part of the journey can be done very efficiently and then you're a lot closer to your customers and you can set up shorter transportation directly to the customer. That is not going to be as cheap as moving from manufacturing to warehouse, but that's only part of the journey. So if your warehouse is really close to the customer, that's a very short amount of time. Also when your customer is ordering goods and they're close to a warehouse, the time from which they place the order to the time that they received the order is very short. So that's how a logistics network is setup typically.

## Warehouse Locations

<img width="1919" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2352819-5cbc-41af-bef8-6bed453cfd99" />

- Now, let's talk about warehouse locations. So in a logistics network, we have two main features. We have transportation lanes and we have warehouse locations. In this example, you'll see five warehouses spread all over the United States. And if you kind of know where population in the United States is, it's mostly on the coast, a little bit less dense in the middle of the country. So we have one warehouse in California, one in Texas, one what looks to be the Upper Midwest Illinois. One and what looks to be Atlanta and the other one looks to be about where Rutgers University is located, around the New Jersey area.
- So when you are setting up a logistics network, most often, if you have a network with five locations, your general locations are going to look pretty much like this. Because as you look at where population is and where customers therefore would be located, it drives these location decisions. And the other part of what you'll see in these examples is the respective territories for these different warehouses. So as you'll you see, the California Warehouse services all of the states that are along the Pacific Oceans. And including Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and so on and parts of other states as well. And one Warehouse that's located in Texas is serving most of that area. It's all driven by population and the shortest distance to the largest number of people.

<img width="1919" height="923" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97ff32ec-d158-4932-9979-41b1c3404345" />

- Here's another view and I always like to show this approach of selecting warehouses. So here we have ten different warehouse networks and it goes line by line. So if we have one warehouse somewhere in, Indiana is the ideal location to place that warehouse. Because it's going to reduce the average distance to customers and therefore, lead to the shortest lead time. Any other location is going to be farther away on average, to the average consumer. So then when we move from one warehouse to two warehouses, then they get spread out to different locations. Now, you'll see, as we move up towards ten warehouses, it's going to lead to slightly different set up.
- Some warehouses are staying in the same spot, others are moving around a little bit. And obviously, this doesn't match the previous example. But one of the lessons that I like to impart from this generic network, is that if you take these location, plus/minus a 100 miles to a 150 miles, you pretty much have the ideal location. Obviously, the locations they picked here, some of them are not necessarily very feasible. So for example, I wouldn't recommend putting a warehouse in Brooklyn New York and and some other locations. But generally, if you take a 100 to a 150 mile radius around those locations, most types of analysis will yield you pretty much the same results. And there are much more advanced sets of analysis that you can perform on this type of location decision. But this is sort of a simple routine way of looking at things.

## Transportation Lanes

<img width="1919" height="950" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5bdc2d9-4267-48fb-88a7-288462bc9d9f" />

- Now let's talk about the transportation lanes. Transportation lanes connect our warehouses to our final consumer. And sometimes we need facilities in between because the transportation company is not necessarily very efficient at moving point to point. So it's we set up transportation facilities similar to airports. Sometimes if you fly from A to B, you have to go to C because that is how the airlines are setting up their system. It's known as a hub and spoke system. Very often in transportation, we have the same type of approach.
- So we could have pickup and delivery terminals and and those are going to be located very close to customers. They pick up items that need to be shipped out. And then if it's the end of the journey, they deliver them to the actual customers. You may also have relay terminals. So if you have a long continuous movement, relay terminals let you change out the drivers so the products can keep moving even if the driver has to stop and rest. And you might also have cross dock terminals where you get full truckloads of goods coming in from a manufacturer for example, and then they break them apart to go to different pickup and delivery terminals in mixed types of products. So transportation facilities are critical in establishing the final linkage between our warehouses and our final consumers.

<img width="1919" height="950" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/210025bc-3781-4e5a-8083-29d5e5bba670" />

- Generally, we try to pick the transportation lane that has the shortest overall distance and it also is a modal choice. So which mode is most appropriate in accomplishing our our service goals. And those are really what are driving the decisions of which transportation lane to use in each specific location.

## Optimization Techniques

<img width="1919" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a549a847-7cec-4481-860b-7f6bf69ec93f" />

- Now, let's talk about how you optimize a logistics network. There are a couple of optimization points. One is to look at the warehouse. You would determine which products to stock, how much of them to stock, and then how to route products throughout your logistics network. There are specific tools that one could pick and you import all of the data that you have about your warehouse, and it will then optimize or pick an ideal amount of product to stock, which products to stock where, and then how to route these products. So there are software techniques. There are also rules of thumbs or heuristics that one could pick.

<img width="1919" height="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58162941-8b4a-42fa-9ed7-ded9ddd6f862" />

- But most companies if they're getting more sophisticated about it, they'll run some kind of an optimization technique on it. Then on the transportation side, the question is about the specific route, how do you build routes? So in other words, where would you place your pickup and delivery terminals. do you have cross stocks, do you have really terminals, etc. So what does the route specifically looked like and then what loads do you put on which route, and how they finally gets to the ultimate customer. Now, then there is another level of optimization which is known as network optimization, how many facilities do we have, where do we place those facilities, what types of transportation do we have, and what service goals do we have? So you take all of those questions into account, and then you come up with locations for facilities and the types of transportation that we use. So that's a more overarching way of optimizing the network, whereas the other two are more internally focused.

<img width="1919" height="955" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4baaf95a-89ff-461f-b808-c206c06061b1" />

- Typically, companies do all three. This network optimization is probably the most important and most immediate one, and then typically you work into the more detailed decision points afterwards.

## Overview of Logistics Relationships

<img width="1919" height="933" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21831e7b-aa93-4098-b104-be76560c3e59" />

- All right now let's talk about logistics relationships. Logistics relationship aren't necessarily your typical buyer-supplier relationship. You're not necessarily buying any product from a logistics service provider, you're buying a service and that service often is a very complex decision that you are making it not as simple as one little box that's being delivered. It's a whole setup of different tasks that a company now is performing for you. Also, you have to realize that your logistic service provider is going to be customer facing. That means, they interact with your customer directly. So you can't necessarily assume that your customer doesn't know you have a logistic service provider, or another way to look at it is if that service provider is doing something they're not supposed to, your customer is going to notice.

<img width="1918" height="941" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7382779-2a24-4430-974a-ddb735499158" />

- Very often these relationships with logistic service provider, when we think back to our procurement segmentation, those are often strategic relationship. So you have to be very careful how you manage them. The other part of it is, when we look at logistics as a department, there's an operational side to it. So that involves driving trucks, loading and unloading, picking products in a warehouse and so on. That type of work is what you typically outsource. Then there is a managerial role on top of it and that's where the lines could be a little bit blurry because some of those functional tasks could be done by the service provider and some you might want to retain yourself and that's where it actually becomes a very interesting because if you are losing the ability to do certain functional tasks and leave it all to the service provider, you might actually lose a lot of your competitive advantage. So as it can be quite dangerous if you move to much of the responsibility to a service provider.
- Although of course a service provider would want you to do that because then the amount of services they sell you is a lot higher. Then finally there's the strategic side which sometimes companies are actually moving to a service provider altogether. Now that I think is generally quite dangerous because then you have very little control over logistics and for the reasons I just mentioned a minute ago, your customers can really notice a lot of differences. So it's very important to maintain tight control over your service providers.

## Warehousing Providers

<img width="1919" height="945" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f909513-976f-4659-b3cd-b86750d7135c" />

- Now, let's talk about the specific example of logistic service providers, and those are warehousing providers. So warehousing provider typically owns the building, has the equipment and workers and does some of the management of that equipment and those workers. How's your products in their facilities and if there is an order, they will pick it from the warehouse shelves, put it in a box have it ready for a transportation provider to pick it up. This type of industry has been around for a very long time. They are always warehousing provider that would work with companies that wouldn't want to run their own warehouses. I'd say in most cases today, a large number of companies don't have their own warehouses, so there's typically some kind of an operator that runs these warehouses for companies. The important question as it is with other logistics relationship, how much of the management should be outsourced?

<img width="1919" height="954" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b7e7d0a-adf4-4016-9980-59bcc5179a3f" />

- So for example, if you have a third party warehouse, should you have people from your organization directly on the ground making sure that all of those tasks that need to be completed are completed the way you want them to be completed? That's one question or is it okay to just have some analysts that are specifically monitoring the performance of those Warehouse? Regardless, the more you take steps back and the less control you have, well the less control you have, and if things aren't going well, you could wake up and have a lot of customers that are not happy. So it's very critical to have the right level of management involved in these types of oversight or control positions.

## Transportation Providers

<img width="1919" height="950" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55324b23-01fe-4172-b64a-bea51876c903" />

- So now let's talk about transportation provider. Transportation providers typically have the vehicles, the facility and the dispatch of those vehicles that are moving your products from point a to point b, point b most likely being your customers. And you also want to have a transportation provider that not only is able to have vehicles move on the road for you, or rail, or air, or ocean, but that also give you a fair amount of control without placing too much of a burden on your own company. So maybe telling each specific driver which route to drive, that is outside of your control. But making sure that all deliveries have been performed at the time they're supposed to be performed, and have performance report at the end of a day or a period, would be quite important. So, again, the control of this operation is one of those interesting little decisions that you get to make when you work with transportation providers. However, you also have to realize that most companies don't want to have their own trucks or workers and so on.
