## How do products flow in Supply Chain?

- Hi everyone, and welcome to the supply chain excellence master track. I'm very excited to be able to teach you. My name is Professor Leuschner, and this course will be one of three, the first one, and we will tackle three parts of the supply chain. So this will be about the product flow, and then the second one will be about information flow, and the third one will be about the financial flow in the supply chain. The goal is to give you a holistic viewpoint of supply chain management and hopefully gets you ready on your intellectual and academic journey in the field of supply chain management. So when we look at what a supply chain looks like, this is my favorite way of displaying it graphically. What we see is where this scarlet little rectangle square in the middle and we have to the one side customers, and we might have several tiers of customers, and to the other side we have suppliers, and we also have several tiers of suppliers.

- We're in this network of companies and ultimately everything leads up to the final consumer. So we want to understand how this structure of the supply chain plays out in three primary flows and those as I mentioned are products, finances, and information. It's important to understand that products flow from the origin of the supply chain all the way to the final consumer,and finances flow backwards, and information flows both ways. Now the interesting thing about these three primary flows is that every product supply chain has them. Incidentally also, what we have to understand is that most supply chain executives are very familiar with product flow, but information flow and financial flows are equally important if not more important in determining the structure of the supply chain because not only do we have the goal of making money, we also are restricted by how much we can invest and spend. So a lot of this master track will focus on the other two fields, but to start with, we're going to focus on product flow and really try to dwell into how product flow exhibits itself and the various forms of the supply chain. I'm very excited to teach this course, and I'm hopeful that you learn a lot.

## Product Flow goals - efficiency

- All right. Now let's talk about product flow goals and specifically focus on efficiency. Now product flow efficiency is one of those things when you look at the supply chain, and you see how products are moving throughout the supply chain you want to make sure there is no waste in the supply chain, no waste in the system. And when we think about what happens to products is this big process of transformation as it moves throughout the supply chain, and so we have products that start off as raw materials and then we do more manufacturing to them and ultimately it leads to the very end of having a finished products. So a supply chain is ultimately a system of transformation and we take resources such as finances, material, labor and equipment and that's what creates the final product in the end. So we need to be very careful with how we use those resources in the best way possible to create the most amount of products in the cheapest, most efficient way. Now when we think about the supply chain, it's not this very quick little thing.

<img width="1919" height="962" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a91f4e4-7708-4232-8991-ced2b7dd8c21" />

- It's not just if we think about a sports analogy of throwing a ball and that's it. It's this long drawn-out process. So the way I always think about it. It's a multi-day race kind of like a bike race or something that takes multiple stages and then those stages are those parts of the supply chain, those different companies at which things happen. So when you think about how to best compete in a long race, you have to pace yourself. You can't go too fast in the beginning because then you'll run out of energy towards the end you also have have to realize that each company is just one little box. But what ultimately makes the final product is the whole supply chain.
- So you have to think outside of that little box of a company that you're in and then another thing is that you can only control what's going on in your company. You can have suggestions for your customers and suggestions for your supplier. But ultimately you can't control them. So when it comes to efficiency, how do we achieve it? Well, there is a well prescribed method of implementing improvements and that's the demake method it comes out of the lean Six Sigma methodology. And it's a process of how to improve pretty much any process. So it always starts with Define.
- How would you measure efficiency in your supply chain? And that's not an easy question to answer, then you measure, you identify metrics that illustrate supply chain efficiency. It could be things like inventory turns, could be financial metrics. It could be time. Third you analyze and by analyzing you're looking for improvements in your supply chain. You're looking within the data that you collected to figure out where are there things that I can improve and what can I make better? Fourth you implement, you make those changes to your supply chain and five you control.
- You make sure that those improvements that you made are stable. So those are the five steps that I recommend you go through when you're trying to improve the efficiency of your supply chain.

## Product Flow goals - flexibility

- Now let's talk about product flow goals, and specifically, flexibility. So when we think about flexibility in the supply chain, what does this mean? If you're looking at a supply chain as a system, flexibility means that you have the ability to vary things. So for example, if you're able to respond to customer demand and changes in customer demand that you didn't anticipate from the beginning, that is one form of flexibility. You never really know what customer demand is, so you can have some guesses, but ultimately, this is not something that you can always be certain about. So flexibility allows you to react to unanticipated levels of customer demand. When we look at at some companies, they've made it a practice of being very well-equipped to react to customer demand, whatever it may be.

<img width="1919" height="971" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a8fed52-1690-4d94-84fb-68e3aed57639" />

- One example would be Zara. I'll have you read about Zara in some of the readings because they've made this one of their competitive advantages. They're better than most of their competitors at making a product, seeing what customer demand is, and then based on that feedback, they're able to either make more or less than what they might have thought they needed. So they let consumers determine how their supply chain is going to react to demand. How would you achieve flexibility? Well, the one thing is speed. You have to be quick in order to react fast enough, because customers are not necessarily willing to wait around for you to manufacture products very slowly.

<img width="1918" height="975" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35dc532d-3dbd-467b-be98-16ad1ca054a9" />

- So you need to be quick. The other one is interchangeability. You need to be as efficient producing different types of products at different times. If you're producing one thing, changing over to another thing should be seamless and quick and easy. Then lastly, it also has to do with design. You have to manufacture products in different ways. For that, you have to develop them so they can be manufactured in different ways. So design plays a very big role in having that flexibility.

## Product Flow goals - resiliency

- Now let's talk about product flow goals and specifically resilience. So the resilient supply chain is one that can basically take a hit. If you think about a boxer, there's some great boxers that could get hit and still kept going. A resilient supply chain is similar. Could it be, let's say, a big hurricane is impacting the area in which you operate, you're able to survive, even without power, without getting supplies delivered, roads being blocked off and so on. So a resilient supply chain is one that can face risks, but they don't lead to disruptions. And disruptions are always a risk that most executives in supply chain management are worried about.
- It's something that is very difficult to plan for. Two factors that are important when it comes to resilience, one is how likely are you to discover a disruption, and the other one is your ability to recover. And those are both two separate things that you need to be concerned about. One is, can you recognize disruptions very early, because if you recognize them early, you have time to avoid them. And the other one is, how good are you at recovering? How good are you at finding alternative ways to doing things until everything comes back to normal? Both of those factors are critical when it comes to building a resilient supply chain.
- And resilience can become a design consideration as you design your supply chain, so you design your supply chain with that resilience in mind. And this can be a very important thing. Depending on your industry, resilience might be one of those things that is very important for you.

## Lean Principles Overview

- Now, in this lesson, we'll talk about lean principles. And lean is one of those important philosophies of supply chain management. So I'll start with a quick overview, and when we think about Lean there's a whole vocabulary of Lean and those of you who are interested in going more deeply into it, you're certainly welcome to do so. But generally, Lean relies on two main principles. And that's just in time, JIT or, and Jidoka, which is error proofing. Because a lean supply chain doesn't have a lot of inventory that just sits around and that just gives that you buffers and you have to have a continuous flow of materials. So, to achieve that continuous flow on the one hand, you have to be able to take away any errors and uncertainty that you could possibly have.

<img width="1919" height="957" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16d0b69c-f440-407b-bba4-d05b0944a18b" />

- So, you have to be very careful when it comes to your processes because nothing really can go wrong otherwise there's going to be a disruption. So when we look at those two overarching principles just-in-time and Jidoka, those are the key goals of making lean work. Then on the other side we also have to have a standardization customer focus planning process, which the Japanese word for that is [FOREIGN]. Looks far into the future and make sure that all of the plans are done in such a way that we can pull off this continuous flow pull system. So planning is one of the important parts of Lean. And you also want stability. You want your processes to be as level as possible because in a manufacturing environment, you always want to avoid big changes because otherwise, one day you have your machines and your workers working really fast and then the other day they have nothing to do.
- So you want to level things out as much as possible. And ultimately, the approach that lean takes, it's an efficiency way of thinking. But the approach is that you have one speed to the supply chain. And that speed matches the speed at which your customers come in. So, if your customers buy products more quickly, then you have to work more quickly. And if your customers are a little slower then you'll slow down the entire supply chain. And that speed mechanism is what's really important to lean.
- In a traditional sense, otherwise you would really not have any need for these these different speeds you work at one speed and you have inventory to balance things out but inventory is not seen as something that you want in a lean system. So that's why you speed up your supply chain when your customers demand it and you slow it down when they don't.

## Lean Thinking Reading by Womak and Jones

- Please take a look at the 
Google Books excerpt of Lean Thinking https://books.google.com/books?id=2eWHaAyiNrgC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false
, by Womak and Jones, which is the essential book on lean. I would ask you to read at least pages 15 to 28.

## The Seven Wastes

- Now, let's talk about the Seven Wastes. So within this Lean, and I'll call it a philosophy, within the Lean philosophy very early on, one of the founders of what today became Lean before then was called the Toyota Production Method. Toyota recognized that they wanted their company to operate differently from other automakers after time for GM and so on. They visited all of them and they tried to learn from all of them and one of the things they recognized was that, all of these other competitors had waste, something that was inherent in the way they did business and Toyota was going to go a very different route and the seven wastes became pretty famous within Toyota and then as Lean kind of came up. The seven wastes are one of the tenants of this Lean thinking if you want. So one of the seven wastes is overproduction. If you produce more than what your customers are willing to buy, what is that, obvious that' s waste.
- You didn't need to use those materials, you didn't need to spend time building those things, you didn't need. Now you have products just sitting around that nobody wants to buy, overproduction is a waste. Second one is inventory. If you believe that your supply chains should be truly just in time, then inventory should be kept to a minimum and inventory in and of itself has no value until it's turned into the final product that a customer wants to buy. So you don't want any inventory at any stage of the supply chain if you can avoid it. Third one is motion. Moving products around just aimlessly back and forth without accomplishing more value or creating more value in the product itself is wasteful.
- You're not achieving anything by moving a product unless it serves a purpose. Fourth one is defects. If you're building a product that has defects and you created something of inferior value, so what you created ultimately is considered a waste because now you either have to throw it out or somebody has to go back in and fix it. So any defect is considered a waste. Related to that, becomes over-processing, because if you have a defect and you need to work on something a second time after you didn't do it right the first time. So over-processing means you have to do things over and over to get it just right. You ideally want to produce a perfect product from the beginning.
- Waiting. Having a product just sit there without adding more value to it consistently is wasteful because you can sequence the task in such a way that there's no waiting. So if you can't accomplish that, then having a product just sitting there doing nothing has no value, so it's wasteful. Then finally, transport. Moving products, unless it is to move it to the final customer is not adding any value to the product, it's wasteful. So these are the seven wastes that were originally identified by Toyota and then later on incorporated into Lean thinking.

## Just-in-Time

<img width="1919" height="1021" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d8a010d-7b0c-4e31-a2e1-2f13cf75f58c" />

- Now, let's talk about just-in-time. And just-in-time as I mentioned, was one of these key objectives of lean supply chains. And the way I would like to talk about just-in-time is, I would like to compare it to a traditional manufacturing system. So we'll talk about several issues and compare and contrast how a traditional supply chain would deal with it, and how just-in-time deals with it. So the first one is inventory. Inventory in a traditional supply chain, you don't want too much inventory, but also too little inventory is no good because that puts you at risk, whereas in a just-in-time point of view, inventory is considered a waste. So any excess inventory above what's absolutely necessary is no good.
- Second issue is lead time, lead times are something you manage around. They are what they are. It's the time from when you send an order to your supplier until you receive it, and whatever it is that's considered appropriate, and you're sort of working around it. In a just-in-time system, lead time should be minimal because you want replenishment to occur very frequently, and therefore the longer your lead time is, the harder it is to really make a just-in-time system work. Now, I've seen examples where lead time was a couple of days, but typically that's not a very good situation. So very often in a lean supply chain, you have all of the suppliers almost surrounding the manufacturing plant, so they are able to deliver within minutes. You're not even talking about hours, you're talking about minutes.
- Batch sizes are something that when you're thinking about okay, we're going to produce this one product, what's the best size? That's the number of how many products we're producing in one continuous production run. And in a traditional system, that's something that you optimize, you figure out the correct number taking into account all of these different factors, maybe DOQ or something like it. And in a just-in-time system, it's ideally about size of one, you produce it, and then whatever the customers demand, that's what gets produced next. It could be the same product, or it could be something completely different, and changeover should not make any difference to you whatsoever. Next is quality. So quality has to be at an acceptable level, it can't be too bad.
- But if it's not perfect, then that's something that's built into the system. Whereas in a just-in-time system you seek for perfection, no quality defects whatsoever at any point in time or at any point in the supply chain either. Because you don't have these inventory buffers in these time buffers. So you're trying to achieve perfection every single time from the beginning. Planning in a traditional system is a push system. So that means you anticipate what customer demand will be, you forecast it, and then you produce to that forecast, and hopefully you're correct about your forecast. And in just-in-time system, it's a pull system.
- So you only produce things that you have a customer order for, and if the customer doesn't order then you don't produce it. It's a very different way of thinking. Next, let's talk about the optimization focus, or what are you trying to optimize in the system? In a traditional system, you look at each part of your supply chain and you optimize it individually, and if each unit is optimized, then you get close to systemwide optimality. Whereas the just-in-time system, you look at the whole unit from the beginning. It's a very important difference. And then lastly, in a traditional system your focus are economies of scale.
- You want to be as big as possible because then as you produce these individual product, you're very efficient in it, and the cost comes down as low as possible. Whereas in a just-in-time system, you want to create efficiency for the entire system, and the system really operates as a one big unit. So as you see, both just-in-time and the traditional system. I'm not saying one is necessarily better than the other, although there are certainly pros and cons to each one of them. But their focus is very different, their philosophy and their approach is very different, and some people are in one camp, some people are in another camp. Certain industries are certainly very heavy into, the lean just-in-time approach, of course.
