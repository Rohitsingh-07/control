## How do products flow in Supply Chain?

- Hi everyone, and welcome to the supply chain excellence master track. I'm very excited to be able to teach you. My name is Professor Leuschner, and this course will be one of three, the first one, and we will tackle three parts of the supply chain. So this will be about the product flow, and then the second one will be about information flow, and the third one will be about the financial flow in the supply chain. The goal is to give you a holistic viewpoint of supply chain management and hopefully gets you ready on your intellectual and academic journey in the field of supply chain management. So when we look at what a supply chain looks like, this is my favorite way of displaying it graphically. What we see is where this scarlet little rectangle square in the middle and we have to the one side customers, and we might have several tiers of customers, and to the other side we have suppliers, and we also have several tiers of suppliers.

- We're in this network of companies and ultimately everything leads up to the final consumer. So we want to understand how this structure of the supply chain plays out in three primary flows and those as I mentioned are products, finances, and information. It's important to understand that products flow from the origin of the supply chain all the way to the final consumer,and finances flow backwards, and information flows both ways. Now the interesting thing about these three primary flows is that every product supply chain has them. Incidentally also, what we have to understand is that most supply chain executives are very familiar with product flow, but information flow and financial flows are equally important if not more important in determining the structure of the supply chain because not only do we have the goal of making money, we also are restricted by how much we can invest and spend. So a lot of this master track will focus on the other two fields, but to start with, we're going to focus on product flow and really try to dwell into how product flow exhibits itself and the various forms of the supply chain. I'm very excited to teach this course, and I'm hopeful that you learn a lot.

## Product Flow goals - efficiency

- All right. Now let's talk about product flow goals and specifically focus on efficiency. Now product flow efficiency is one of those things when you look at the supply chain, and you see how products are moving throughout the supply chain you want to make sure there is no waste in the supply chain, no waste in the system. And when we think about what happens to products is this big process of transformation as it moves throughout the supply chain, and so we have products that start off as raw materials and then we do more manufacturing to them and ultimately it leads to the very end of having a finished products. So a supply chain is ultimately a system of transformation and we take resources such as finances, material, labor and equipment and that's what creates the final product in the end. So we need to be very careful with how we use those resources in the best way possible to create the most amount of products in the cheapest, most efficient way. Now when we think about the supply chain, it's not this very quick little thing.

<img width="1919" height="962" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a91f4e4-7708-4232-8991-ced2b7dd8c21" />

- It's not just if we think about a sports analogy of throwing a ball and that's it. It's this long drawn-out process. So the way I always think about it. It's a multi-day race kind of like a bike race or something that takes multiple stages and then those stages are those parts of the supply chain, those different companies at which things happen. So when you think about how to best compete in a long race, you have to pace yourself. You can't go too fast in the beginning because then you'll run out of energy towards the end you also have have to realize that each company is just one little box. But what ultimately makes the final product is the whole supply chain.
- So you have to think outside of that little box of a company that you're in and then another thing is that you can only control what's going on in your company. You can have suggestions for your customers and suggestions for your supplier. But ultimately you can't control them. So when it comes to efficiency, how do we achieve it? Well, there is a well prescribed method of implementing improvements and that's the demake method it comes out of the lean Six Sigma methodology. And it's a process of how to improve pretty much any process. So it always starts with Define.
- How would you measure efficiency in your supply chain? And that's not an easy question to answer, then you measure, you identify metrics that illustrate supply chain efficiency. It could be things like inventory turns, could be financial metrics. It could be time. Third you analyze and by analyzing you're looking for improvements in your supply chain. You're looking within the data that you collected to figure out where are there things that I can improve and what can I make better? Fourth you implement, you make those changes to your supply chain and five you control.
- You make sure that those improvements that you made are stable. So those are the five steps that I recommend you go through when you're trying to improve the efficiency of your supply chain.

## Product Flow goals - flexibility

- Now let's talk about product flow goals, and specifically, flexibility. So when we think about flexibility in the supply chain, what does this mean? If you're looking at a supply chain as a system, flexibility means that you have the ability to vary things. So for example, if you're able to respond to customer demand and changes in customer demand that you didn't anticipate from the beginning, that is one form of flexibility. You never really know what customer demand is, so you can have some guesses, but ultimately, this is not something that you can always be certain about. So flexibility allows you to react to unanticipated levels of customer demand. When we look at at some companies, they've made it a practice of being very well-equipped to react to customer demand, whatever it may be.

<img width="1919" height="971" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a8fed52-1690-4d94-84fb-68e3aed57639" />

- One example would be Zara. I'll have you read about Zara in some of the readings because they've made this one of their competitive advantages. They're better than most of their competitors at making a product, seeing what customer demand is, and then based on that feedback, they're able to either make more or less than what they might have thought they needed. So they let consumers determine how their supply chain is going to react to demand. How would you achieve flexibility? Well, the one thing is speed. You have to be quick in order to react fast enough, because customers are not necessarily willing to wait around for you to manufacture products very slowly.

<img width="1918" height="975" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35dc532d-3dbd-467b-be98-16ad1ca054a9" />

- So you need to be quick. The other one is interchangeability. You need to be as efficient producing different types of products at different times. If you're producing one thing, changing over to another thing should be seamless and quick and easy. Then lastly, it also has to do with design. You have to manufacture products in different ways. For that, you have to develop them so they can be manufactured in different ways. So design plays a very big role in having that flexibility.

## Product Flow goals - resiliency

- Now let's talk about product flow goals and specifically resilience. So the resilient supply chain is one that can basically take a hit. If you think about a boxer, there's some great boxers that could get hit and still kept going. A resilient supply chain is similar. Could it be, let's say, a big hurricane is impacting the area in which you operate, you're able to survive, even without power, without getting supplies delivered, roads being blocked off and so on. So a resilient supply chain is one that can face risks, but they don't lead to disruptions. And disruptions are always a risk that most executives in supply chain management are worried about.
- It's something that is very difficult to plan for. Two factors that are important when it comes to resilience, one is how likely are you to discover a disruption, and the other one is your ability to recover. And those are both two separate things that you need to be concerned about. One is, can you recognize disruptions very early, because if you recognize them early, you have time to avoid them. And the other one is, how good are you at recovering? How good are you at finding alternative ways to doing things until everything comes back to normal? Both of those factors are critical when it comes to building a resilient supply chain.
- And resilience can become a design consideration as you design your supply chain, so you design your supply chain with that resilience in mind. And this can be a very important thing. Depending on your industry, resilience might be one of those things that is very important for you.

## Lean Principles Overview

- Now, in this lesson, we'll talk about lean principles. And lean is one of those important philosophies of supply chain management. So I'll start with a quick overview, and when we think about Lean there's a whole vocabulary of Lean and those of you who are interested in going more deeply into it, you're certainly welcome to do so. But generally, Lean relies on two main principles. And that's just in time, JIT or, and Jidoka, which is error proofing. Because a lean supply chain doesn't have a lot of inventory that just sits around and that just gives that you buffers and you have to have a continuous flow of materials. So, to achieve that continuous flow on the one hand, you have to be able to take away any errors and uncertainty that you could possibly have.

<img width="1919" height="957" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16d0b69c-f440-407b-bba4-d05b0944a18b" />

- So, you have to be very careful when it comes to your processes because nothing really can go wrong otherwise there's going to be a disruption. So when we look at those two overarching principles just-in-time and Jidoka, those are the key goals of making lean work. Then on the other side we also have to have a standardization customer focus planning process, which the Japanese word for that is [FOREIGN]. Looks far into the future and make sure that all of the plans are done in such a way that we can pull off this continuous flow pull system. So planning is one of the important parts of Lean. And you also want stability. You want your processes to be as level as possible because in a manufacturing environment, you always want to avoid big changes because otherwise, one day you have your machines and your workers working really fast and then the other day they have nothing to do.
- So you want to level things out as much as possible. And ultimately, the approach that lean takes, it's an efficiency way of thinking. But the approach is that you have one speed to the supply chain. And that speed matches the speed at which your customers come in. So, if your customers buy products more quickly, then you have to work more quickly. And if your customers are a little slower then you'll slow down the entire supply chain. And that speed mechanism is what's really important to lean.
- In a traditional sense, otherwise you would really not have any need for these these different speeds you work at one speed and you have inventory to balance things out but inventory is not seen as something that you want in a lean system. So that's why you speed up your supply chain when your customers demand it and you slow it down when they don't.

## The Seven Wastes

- Now, let's talk about the Seven Wastes. So within this Lean, and I'll call it a philosophy, within the Lean philosophy very early on, one of the founders of what today became Lean before then was called the Toyota Production Method. Toyota recognized that they wanted their company to operate differently from other automakers after time for GM and so on. They visited all of them and they tried to learn from all of them and one of the things they recognized was that, all of these other competitors had waste, something that was inherent in the way they did business and Toyota was going to go a very different route and the seven wastes became pretty famous within Toyota and then as Lean kind of came up. The seven wastes are one of the tenants of this Lean thinking if you want. So one of the seven wastes is overproduction. If you produce more than what your customers are willing to buy, what is that, obvious that' s waste.
- You didn't need to use those materials, you didn't need to spend time building those things, you didn't need. Now you have products just sitting around that nobody wants to buy, overproduction is a waste. Second one is inventory. If you believe that your supply chains should be truly just in time, then inventory should be kept to a minimum and inventory in and of itself has no value until it's turned into the final product that a customer wants to buy. So you don't want any inventory at any stage of the supply chain if you can avoid it. Third one is motion. Moving products around just aimlessly back and forth without accomplishing more value or creating more value in the product itself is wasteful.
- You're not achieving anything by moving a product unless it serves a purpose. Fourth one is defects. If you're building a product that has defects and you created something of inferior value, so what you created ultimately is considered a waste because now you either have to throw it out or somebody has to go back in and fix it. So any defect is considered a waste. Related to that, becomes over-processing, because if you have a defect and you need to work on something a second time after you didn't do it right the first time. So over-processing means you have to do things over and over to get it just right. You ideally want to produce a perfect product from the beginning.
- Waiting. Having a product just sit there without adding more value to it consistently is wasteful because you can sequence the task in such a way that there's no waiting. So if you can't accomplish that, then having a product just sitting there doing nothing has no value, so it's wasteful. Then finally, transport. Moving products, unless it is to move it to the final customer is not adding any value to the product, it's wasteful. So these are the seven wastes that were originally identified by Toyota and then later on incorporated into Lean thinking.

## Just-in-Time

<img width="1919" height="1021" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d8a010d-7b0c-4e31-a2e1-2f13cf75f58c" />

- Now, let's talk about just-in-time. And just-in-time as I mentioned, was one of these key objectives of lean supply chains. And the way I would like to talk about just-in-time is, I would like to compare it to a traditional manufacturing system. So we'll talk about several issues and compare and contrast how a traditional supply chain would deal with it, and how just-in-time deals with it. So the first one is inventory. Inventory in a traditional supply chain, you don't want too much inventory, but also too little inventory is no good because that puts you at risk, whereas in a just-in-time point of view, inventory is considered a waste. So any excess inventory above what's absolutely necessary is no good.
- Second issue is lead time, lead times are something you manage around. They are what they are. It's the time from when you send an order to your supplier until you receive it, and whatever it is that's considered appropriate, and you're sort of working around it. In a just-in-time system, lead time should be minimal because you want replenishment to occur very frequently, and therefore the longer your lead time is, the harder it is to really make a just-in-time system work. Now, I've seen examples where lead time was a couple of days, but typically that's not a very good situation. So very often in a lean supply chain, you have all of the suppliers almost surrounding the manufacturing plant, so they are able to deliver within minutes. You're not even talking about hours, you're talking about minutes.
- Batch sizes are something that when you're thinking about okay, we're going to produce this one product, what's the best size? That's the number of how many products we're producing in one continuous production run. And in a traditional system, that's something that you optimize, you figure out the correct number taking into account all of these different factors, maybe DOQ or something like it. And in a just-in-time system, it's ideally about size of one, you produce it, and then whatever the customers demand, that's what gets produced next. It could be the same product, or it could be something completely different, and changeover should not make any difference to you whatsoever. Next is quality. So quality has to be at an acceptable level, it can't be too bad.
- But if it's not perfect, then that's something that's built into the system. Whereas in a just-in-time system you seek for perfection, no quality defects whatsoever at any point in time or at any point in the supply chain either. Because you don't have these inventory buffers in these time buffers. So you're trying to achieve perfection every single time from the beginning. Planning in a traditional system is a push system. So that means you anticipate what customer demand will be, you forecast it, and then you produce to that forecast, and hopefully you're correct about your forecast. And in just-in-time system, it's a pull system.
- So you only produce things that you have a customer order for, and if the customer doesn't order then you don't produce it. It's a very different way of thinking. Next, let's talk about the optimization focus, or what are you trying to optimize in the system? In a traditional system, you look at each part of your supply chain and you optimize it individually, and if each unit is optimized, then you get close to systemwide optimality. Whereas the just-in-time system, you look at the whole unit from the beginning. It's a very important difference. And then lastly, in a traditional system your focus are economies of scale.
- You want to be as big as possible because then as you produce these individual product, you're very efficient in it, and the cost comes down as low as possible. Whereas in a just-in-time system, you want to create efficiency for the entire system, and the system really operates as a one big unit. So as you see, both just-in-time and the traditional system. I'm not saying one is necessarily better than the other, although there are certainly pros and cons to each one of them. But their focus is very different, their philosophy and their approach is very different, and some people are in one camp, some people are in another camp. Certain industries are certainly very heavy into, the lean just-in-time approach, of course.

## Jidoka (error proofing)

- Now, let's finish up Lean Principle by talking about the other important concept in addition to Just-in-time and that's Jidoka. So Jidoka means error proofing and the idea behind it is that you want to build your whole supply chain system in such a way that it is very difficult for individual workers to make mistakes. So what I mean by that? As you want to build quality into each process and each part of the process. You want to empower the workers on the ground to detect anything that's outside of this perfection that you're striving for. So anything that's unusual has to be detected right away. If there is a mistake that you detect then you immediately stop and fix it right then and there.

<img width="1919" height="969" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e699d510-a0ec-4220-895c-966e4278c2b2" />

- When you think about how you build the system as you almost want to make it impossible for anybody that operates in the supply chain to do the wrong thing. So one example, if you see the image here that we have is a board with different bolts and there are all numbered displayed for the worker right there to see. So if one of the critical things that you have to do is to make sure you install the right bolt into the right position than having this board with all of the different option, allows the workers to take a bolt out of let's say bag of bolts and you hold it right up to this board and you see, okay this is the correct bolt I can see it. It's very easy to determine and I'm putting the right part into the right location. If you look at lean facilities, there's all kinds of these little reminders for workers to check and make sure that they are doing things the correct way right from the beginning.

## The Agile Supply Chain

- Now let's talk about agility and the agile supply chain. So when we're talking about a supply chain that is agile, what do we mean? Well, it's fast, an agile supply chain can react to any changes very quickly. It's also flexible, so when you have an agile supply chain, you don't worry too much about, say, getting your forecast perfect right from the beginning. Because you have speed and flexibility to make sure that the changes in consumer demand on this one product, you react to it. And the third important piece of an agile supply chain is experimentation. You're willing to try new things out, see if they work.

<img width="1919" height="1039" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ca8ac2b-f92f-4159-9a19-6e27c7084c75" />

- And if they do work, then they could become a major part of your company, and if they don't work, you move on to the next thing. So it's this very entrepreneurial approach to supply chain management, which is very different from both a Lean approach and sort of your traditional economies of scale. Because economies of scale, you try to have everything as fixed as possible, and in Lean you want to sort of move with the speed of customer, but you don't want to be changing things around constantly and chasing new trends and trying new things. So an agile supply chain typically is very popular in, for example, the fashion industry, where you have new trends, and you want to take advantage of those trends. And once a trend dies down, you shut this one part down and you move over to something completely different, and then you start up something new, and all the time you're just chasing trend after trend after trend. That's when an agile supply chain has to be implemented, because otherwise if you're waiting on long lead times and making sure everything is set up, or you have the whole supply chain build, the trend is over by then. So an agile supply chain doesn't really worry about establishing anything permanent, everything is up to change and you really want to focus on being able to keep up.

## Implement Agility

<img width="1919" height="1008" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7feccfc2-53e0-408a-a783-6194e84727ac" />

- So now let's talk about how you implement agility. Well, obviously, we recognize there are three important things when it comes to agility, speed, flexibility and experimentation. How do you implement speed? Well, when we think about the internal part of our supply chain, you source product, you make them and then you deliver them, you want everything to be faster. So faster sourcing, faster manufacturing and faster deliveries, the more speed you have in the time when you touch the product, the better. With faster sourcing, you want to reduce wait time, you want small lead times as much as possible in manufacturing. You also want to reduce your wait time by not having product sort of sit around on the factory floor as they're getting built.
- Everything has to be quick, quick, quick, and then in terms of delivery, you're not having something sit around an inventory for days or weeks at a time. You want to get them out the door as quickly as possible. So, speed has to be built in all three phases of your internal supply chain. Then flexibility. Well, one of the important things about achieving flexibility is that you work in teams, and those teams are able to each take each other's role. So it doesn't matter which member of the team does which task because everybody's trained to do everything. So you create short production runs, you focused on being fast and changeovers are very quick and easy, and you don't really have a lot of infrastructure involved.

<img width="1919" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f29ef58e-a8fc-49ba-bc22-120cd337b8a7" />

- It's sort of this very entrepreneurial almost startup like atmosphere in each part of your supply chain. And then finally, experimentation. We mentioned was the third thing, so you want to strive for efficiency without ever sacrificing speed or flexibility. So you want to do more with less, you want to have processes in place, but whatever it goes in the process can be different. So, processes are important, but they're not there to really stay a long time. But you sort of have always have a blueprint as soon as you start up in a new thing. Another important thing is you tolerate failure, if you're willing to experiment, you're willing to try new things, follow trends.

<img width="1919" height="971" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06a3494d-8277-4601-bb2a-3ec627d23a51" />

- If a trend doesn't necessarily work out as you anticipated, that's okay because you move on to the next thing, and they help you learn and refine your processes. So you want within your own teams to reward creativity where you want to make it very easy for people to take risks. And the third one is build a culture of innovation. So the more innovation you have in place, the better. And it's something that rubs off on everybody else when there is this culture of everybody's trying new things and it almost gets competitive in a way.

## Agile versus Efficient

<img width="1919" height="1009" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/870af3d7-1b12-4c46-a57d-68ee6b14cb04" />

- So now let's finish up Agility by comparing Agile versus efficient supply chains. So one of the things that we have to ask is because Agile doesn't really have the term efficiency, this is not one of the things that Agile supply chain necessarily seemed to care for publicly because it's all about speed and flexibility and experimentation. But we have to ask ourselves what's our value to the customer? When we think about value, what is it that customers are willing to pay for and if customers can get value from your company that they cannot get anywhere else, well, that might actually be a form of efficiency. So when we think about Agile versus efficient, yeah, it's different types of companies maybe even different types of Industry. But I'm not ready to call Agile inefficient because obviously those companies that are following this model are definitely delivering something to the customer that customers are looking for. Within most industries, when we're looking at the speed of innovation and new products coming in, one thing that we can recognize is that trends are happening faster and faster.

<img width="1919" height="974" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7029778f-292d-4b52-8e4c-12616b58ccb3" />

- With those faster and faster trends, sometimes trends are built into fashion, certain things are just popular at the time and then technology is changing more and more rapidly. Can companies really build a product and expect it to last for years and years or maybe even decades? The overall environment of the industry might actually force a lot of companies to become more Agile.

## The Resilient Supply Chain

- Now let's talk about risk and a supply chain that will voice as much risk as possible I would call a Brazilian supply chain. So when we think about what makes a supply chain resilient. On the one hand, it has the ability to resist disruptions from manifesting themselves. And on the other hand also, it has the ability to recover more quickly. So it's both this ability to not really be impacted by any disruption and the ability to bounce back quickly. Those are two important factors and a resilient supply chain really has both. It's not one or the other but it has to have both in place at the same time.

<img width="1919" height="980" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ce779d6-4cf9-4f98-9961-21646d58996c" />

<img width="1919" height="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bcf6a84-b397-41c4-8cf1-f441816ed0d1" />

- And when we think about how disruptions really happened, there's a pretty distinct timeline. So it starts with trying to avoid any disruptions and if one happens the first order of business has to be to contain that disruption. And then you move very quickly into stabilizing your supply chain before you you get back to your normal. So those are the four stages that are really important in when you encounter a disruption. So when you look at let's say a natural disaster hits. First thing is you make sure you understand exactly what happens, what parts are impacted. And make sure that anything that happened to your supply chain has shielded off from from the rest of your company.
- And as you find ways to work around the disruption, you stabilize it and then you quickly work on returning to normal. So you build everything back up. You get back to the state that you previously had. So it's important to recognize that every disruption just goes through that natural progression of things.

## Supply Chain Risk Factors

<img width="1919" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6d5d585-f862-4c83-804d-90fe7999b5b4" />

- Now, let's talk about supply chain risk factors. So when we think about the different types of risks that you could have impacting your company, I'll give you one way of thinking about it. If you look out there at other sources you might find other ones, but I'll give you my version of it. I'd like to look at the procurement side, the manufacturing side, and the logistic side. So we'll start with procurement risks, and procurement risk is typically focused around suppliers and what happens in their realm and there are things that might swap over to your organization. So the first one and probably the more common one is natural disasters that could impact your suppliers, especially when you have areas that are clustered with certain types of suppliers. Remember a couple years ago there was a big flood in Thailand and a lot of computer suppliers were located in that area and they had their operations impacted by that flood.
- When the tsunami hit in Japan a lot of automotive suppliers were impacted, so natural disasters are definitely one category. Another one is political disruptions, and those could be through maybe a government gets overturned or there are change in policies and they impact how goods flow in and out of that country. So political risk can definitely be present. The third category of risk is process risk. Something within the suppliers manufacturing process, we're broke and it didn't necessarily get fixed in time. So now you see a decline in your orders that are delivered, you're not getting as much product as you anticipated, and so it's due to some internal failure. Definitely an important one.
- Then finally, financial risk. The supplier is either going out of business or threatening to go out of business or there's some kind of a financial issue, and that happens occasionally and you as the customer then obviously are at risk because that supplier might not exist anymore and you have to find a way to deal with it. Next we'll talked about manufacturing risk and you see some of those same categories, your operations might be hit by some natural disaster or there's some political risk that affects your own operations or something in your process has gone wrong, maybe you didn't detect a quality issue that you might have had announced starts impacting the types of products you produce. So similar risks and similar risk also on the logistic side but now they affect your customer. So your deliveries might be slowed down to some natural event or political risk or it could be things like strikes. So sometimes dock workers are striking so no products get in and out of a certain port, or something in your own delivery process has gone wrong and you're not delivering the right products to the right customers. So that's one categorization of risks, and I think this is particularly suitable for the area of supply chain management to think about procurement, manufacturing, and logistics. As I said before, there are other ones out there but I like to think about it in those three categories.

## Risk vs. Efficiency, can we afford it?

<img width="1919" height="1030" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76e33b87-022f-4fcc-8a54-56a64b17c165" />

- Now let's finish up the discussion on risk by comparing risk versus efficiency. So when we think about risk mitigation or resilience, it is one of those things that you have to weigh off against your overall quest for efficiency. Because if you're as efficient as possible, you might not have the ability to focus on avoidance as much. So as you build in different things that that help you avoid risks, that is possibly going to detract from your overall accomplishment of resiliency. And then on the other hand also, as you recover that, then your efficiencies' definitely going to take a hit. However, if you build in recovery mechanisms, maybe your peak efficiency is not as high, but the recovery part will be a lot easier if you thought about it. So, there are some trade-offs necessary when you think about being resilient and being efficient.
- And lastly, I want to touch a little bit on when it comes to risk mitigation, there are certain things that you can do. And most companies are going to have some kind of an insurance system in place that in the event of a disruption, there are certain types of insurance policy that compensate you financially. That part is fine, but that's only financial compensation and that's not going to cover everything, or the entire loss that you would experience in a disruption. Next thing you can do is to have a flexible supply chain. So now you start seeing when we look at all of these different goals, flexibility can actually help you with risk mitigation. Because you're able to shift things around, work around, isolate certain parts of your business, work around them. You have people who can do multiple jobs, so they're able to help out, and you can overcome disruptions a lot easier when you have flexibility.

- Another thing that you could do is to have redundancy in place. So you have multiples of everything, so if one part breaks down, you have a back-up plan and you're able to start right back up. And the fourth one is inventory. So if you have plenty of inventory even if your manufacturing shuts down or a supplier is down, you have plenty of inventory. That's only going to be a tiny blip in your overall output because you have inventory to carry you through. Now I realize inventory is one of those things that could be considered a waste, but when it comes to disruption it's one of those essential things that give you some time to recover and customers are still going to receive their product. And that gives you time.
- So you trade off time versus inventory when it comes to resilience. So there are things that you can do to mitigate. All of them take a little bit away from efficiency, but it allows you to bounce back a lot faster so they're not insignificant.
