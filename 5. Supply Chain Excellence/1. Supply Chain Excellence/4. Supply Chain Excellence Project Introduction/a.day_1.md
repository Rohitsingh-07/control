## The Purpose

This project is designed to analyze the supply chain of a company from three perspectives and will continue across all  courses of this Specialization:

Sourcing Excellence (ungraded peer feedback)

Operations Excellence (ungraded peer feedback)

Logistics Excellence (ungraded peer feedback)

Supply Chain Excellence Capstone (final graded project due)

At the end of the project, you will have applied everything you learned on a topic of your choosing and have shown mastery over the concepts we learned during this program. This experience will give you the tools to understand how companies operate their supply chains and, more importantly, give you an appreciation of what it takes to succeed in a highly competitive marketplace.

## The Company

The project is centered around a real company. You can select a company that you will analyze in depth, but please keep the following guidelines in mind:

You cannot select a company that your currently work for. I want you to apply your knowledge and skills to something new and picking your company will create bias.

Pick a company that will allow you to find a lot of information. Publically traded companies publish quarterly and annual reports, revealing a lot of information. Please do not pick privately-held companies because it will make it too difficult to find information.

Consider a company that will be interesting to you. Maybe you would like to get a job there. Or, it is one of your employers' main customers or supplier. But maybe, you just love their products...

If you are not sure, or cannot decide, please feel free to reach out to me.

## The Deliverables

Your project will consist of three parts, each due at the end of a course. At the end of this course, you will have submitted three parts of this project:

Sourcing

Sourcing (revised) + Operations

Sourcing (revised) + Operations (revised) + Logistics

The idea is that you can make your project better over the course of this specialization, so I ask you to keep working on the first and second parts as you go through the course. At the end of this program, I hope the work you submit is the best you have ever done.

Each part will grow as you continue through the submissions so that towards the end of the program, you will have accumulated about 20 pages of material (as a rough guide). I will not consider length, but you will have difficulty doing a great job if there are considerably fewer materials in most cases. In other cases, the length can be longer (but if you are too repetitive, I may ask you to condense). That said, the first submission (in this course) doesn't need to be longer than five pages (regular formatting).

In this course, you will have to submit the following:

You have picked a company that you would like to analyze. This part focuses on the flow of products, information, and finances. As such, you will describe their  supply chain in as much detail as possible:

Describe the company - (approx. half a page)

Describe the overall industry in which the company operates, including major customers, competitors, and suppliers. - (approx. half a page)

Company's products and possibly identify product lines (grouping similar products together) - (approx. half a page)

Procurement (who are their main suppliers and what do they provide) - (approx. one page)

Operations (what plants do they have and where are they located) - (approx. one page)

Logistics (warehouses, transportation, and inventory) - (approx. one page)

Supply Chain Objectives (efficiency, agility, resilience, etc.) - (approx. half a page)
