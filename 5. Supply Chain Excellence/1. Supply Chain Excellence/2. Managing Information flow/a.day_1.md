## Information Flow in the Supply Chain

<img width="1919" height="936" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86a39c76-2e0e-436d-87e0-b110256d8871" />

- Now let's talk about the information flow in the supply chain in general. So what types of information would a company typically have? Well, there's information about orders, there's information about inventory, and there's information that you produce in terms of forecasts. And forecasting is one of the hardest things to do well in a supply chain, yet the better you get at forecasting and the better you forecast, the easier everything else that you do in the supply chain is. It's easier to manufacture stuff if your forecast's good, it's easier to position inventory where you need it if your forecast is good. It's easier to buy raw materials. Now, having a great forecast is not easy, but the better you get at it, the better everything else will get as well.
- So when we look at the information, the information is not just internal information, but it's information we can get from our customers. Our customers often will pass some of their forecasts to us. If not the forecast, then specific orders. We will pass orders on to suppliers, and sometimes we share with them our view of the future. We receive information from suppliers in terms of here's how much we have available, or here's what we plan on doing. And all of this information has to be used in a meaningful way in order to create a proper business and execution plan for the supply chain.

## Supply Chain IT In action

Take a look at the following page, which outlines very nicely how different IT systems can work together:

## Local Information Systems

- So one type of information system that I'm going to talk about is a local information system. What do I mean by that? So a local information system would be something that is hosted maybe on a computer. So the work you do on your own personal computer and that gets stored in there. Let's say you have some data that you plan to work on and say for argument's sake you're doing a forecast with that data. So as you download some information on it you manipulated in certain way. You make your decisions based on that and then you bring that information you shared with your co-workers or whoever you interact with.
- In most supply chains, a lot of the work that you will do are creating and using information is it's going to be done locally on your personal device even interacting with suppliers via email. For example, that's done locally. It's just done in one type of device. Now the reason why I start with that is that when you look at supply chains that are more sophisticated and more advanced, some of that local work is pushed into enterprise-wide or maybe even supply chain wide systems that document things a little bit better. Provide visibility as to what everybody is doing within different parts of the supply chain. So, usually, the more personal spreadsheets and pieces of data that are proprietary to one person you have, that's usually a sign that either the information systems infrastructure of the enterprise is not working very well, or it may even be non-existent. Usually if you have a strong infrastructure, however, and people are downloading what stuff and maintaining their own spreadsheets that's a big sign that the information is either not very usable.

<img width="1919" height="952" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c28449ce-a01c-4cb6-ae0f-ef44659a07c9" />

- Otherwise, why would they keep their own spreadsheets or it's not very accurate and you can't necessarily rely on it. So you need to manipulate it in a certain way. So, usually if you see people saying that they make decision based on their own personal spreadsheets, that's not a good sign. So, if you see that I would be very wary that usually points to there being some kind of a problem. And this is sort of the workflow that you would do. You download some information from a database, manipulate it and then enter decisions into another system. In an idealized case, you want all of that to happen in one in the same system, without the that middle step of downloading the data manipulating and uploading it back into another system

## Internal Information Systems

<img width="1910" height="1027" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d37b154e-3774-4499-a475-eff6da54bb12" />

- Now let's talk about internal information systems and those information systems are ones that are internal to one company. So examples of that would be for example an S&OP system. An S&OP system typically is used to take operational data and sales data, marry them up and create a sales and operations plan and that sales and operations plan of ways to forecast versus the capacity of the organization and tries to create some balance. It's also a result of a bunch of other systems that feed into it, such as maybe you have a forecasting system or you have some capacity management system. A lot of companies today would have an S&OP system, so it's fairly common place. The second type of system that I want to talk about is an MRP system, materials requirements system or materials resource system depending on the level of sophistication and those were actually around for a very long time. There are organizations back in the '60s and '70s that had early versions of MRP systems.
- Then what an MRP system does is ultimately it creates a production overview. I don't want to call it a production plan yet because that's what the master planning and scheduling system, the MPS system does. But an MRP system will typically tell you whether you have enough resources available to execute a certain demand plan. So that's why sometimes you have the back-and-forth with the S&OP system but typically it looks at all of the labor you have, all the machine capacity, and it sees if you can make a certain demand plan work. A master production schedule lays out in fine increments, sometimes down to the second what each machine in a production facility will work on, for how long, when it will switch over to something else, what the different people who are supposed to run these machines are doing and at all times. So that's the output of mass production schedule. A DRP system stands for distribution requirements planning, that takes all of your finished goods and then spreads them out according to where you think sales will occur in the field, so which warehouses are going to get which inventory, how much of it.

<img width="1917" height="966" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea1b9ed4-507d-4017-aecd-30dff5d68bab" />

- Finally once inventory is in a warehouse, it is managed by a warehouse management system that controls the whole flow from receiving items to shipping them out and transportation will be managed by, believe it or not, a transportation management system, so that will have all of the movements of the different vehicles that you deploy to ship out your goods. So those would be what I would see as the most common supply chain system that a company would have internally. So now let me talk in a little bit more detail about the sales and operations planning. So you have forecast coming in, you have financial goals, you have plant capacity, and you have supplier capacity. The main question that you're trying to answer is, what are we making and what are we selling. In a materials requirements planning system, we feed in the forecast, we feed in the inventory, we feed in the bill of material and we also have our master production schedule. There should really be a double-headed arrow coming into the master production schedule but it will tell you what the raw materials to buy and in what quantity.

<img width="1919" height="957" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce850577-7f9b-40d4-869d-ae121d368a55" />

<img width="1919" height="977" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e5505b0-716e-41fc-9179-803a2df368d0" />

<img width="1919" height="950" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1c10a78-156d-4038-87b4-3a07d161588e" />

<img width="1919" height="1028" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed4bed6d-0ea5-48c6-90c6-c8c70253779e" />

<img width="1919" height="916" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bc6ec32-46b5-4d66-a221-870648da1529" />

- So the master production schedule will use the forecast, the inventory, the bill of material, your machine utilization, your labor availability, and tell you what products to make, when, and what quantity and will layout as I said by minute what activities you'll do exactly. Distribution requirements planning, you're trying to determine what products to stock in each warehouse and in what quantity. So you'll use the forecast, the inventory, the production data. Your available capacity to store and your available capacity to transport and that will then make the determination of where to put all of your inventory in your entire logistics network. Warehouse management system will have a log for all the stock keeping units, the SKUs, the locations where you can put stuff, the orders you're getting in and the replenishments you're getting in. The main task is to determine where are your stocks located within the warehouse but it will also work on optimizing how you bring in orders, optimizing how you ship out orders, so it's both that receiving and that shipping of orders that is managed. So tell every warehouse worker exactly where to walk to, how to pick orders, and in what sequence.
- Then finally a transportation management system. What shipments do we have, where are they going and in what order are we fulfilling them? So you get information from all, the orders that you have, the locations, both that they originate from and the locations that they have to go to and the resources you have available. So the trucks, the drivers will all feed into this TMS system and then it will put together a plan and here's how we're going to deliver all of these different orders. Sometimes there is the capability to do routing even, although that's not necessarily always the case but they're more sophisticated ones will tell the driver exactly in what order to deliver certain products to customers.

## External Information Systems

- So now, let's talk about external information systems. And these are information systems that reach beyond the four walls of the organization. So they connect either to customers or suppliers. And there are six types of systems I want to highlight, some of them are fairly self-explanatory because they mainly deal with tracking what's going on. So the first one we'll start with POS systems, the point of sale system. What point of sale systems do is they kind of like cash register plus the big roll of paper that usually used to be in a cash register. The only difference is that roll of paper is now digital trail of data and it tracks what items have been sold.

<img width="1919" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e11fc58-6fa1-4987-a881-5867268263c7" />

- And then over time you can use that data to see what buying trends have been. If you have a large organization and you have thousands of these point-of-sale terminals, you're going to get lots of information that you can then slice and dice in different ways. Leading up to that point of sale, we have inventory tracking systems. And those are systems that attempt to track inventory across companies. So they give companies visibility into suppliers and maybe customers and everybody shares that visibility. And the general idea is if we can track inventory more of a space you're going to be able to have better decisions because now you see how the inventory flows from point to point. There are also order tracking systems and those systems are recording orders as they come in from customers and that gives you an overview of what the ordering patterns from different customers are.
- Then we have CRM systems, customer relationship management systems, and and those typically contain information about a given customer. So they might have an order tracking capability where you pull up a customer and you see all of the orders they placed but they also might have other information, maybe payments information. Maybe you have information about what their plans are or how to engage with them better. There are whole host of different CRM type systems and people find more and more uses for them. For example, Rutgers University uses a CRM system for admissions. So it's customized towards seeing how prospective students are progressing through the different stages of the admission cycle, so they can be very useful to track customer data, then hopefully help you make decisions on how to do a better job interacting with customer. Then we have risk management systems.
- And what those systems are generally designed to do is to give companies early warning on potential supply chain risk that they may be facing. There's a company in Silicon Valley called Wrestlinc and they are, I would say, one of the early ones and what they're doing is they allow companies to enter in information about all of their suppliers and then they will track those suppliers. And if, for example, there is a natural disaster in an area where one of your suppliers has a factory, you'll get a notification. So you don't rely on that supplier to tell you that, hey, we had to shut down our factory, you actually get the news ahead of time so you can start planning earlier. So if you have a disruption in your supply chain, the sooner you can know about it the better it is. And that's what these systems are designed to do. And then finally, I want to talk about a type of system, which really the idea of it came up in the late 90s, I would say and that's a CPFR system.

<img width="1919" height="903" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ca41628-5028-4705-9aa7-b76276e1495f" />

- And the history of CPFR actually was a voluntary alliance of different companies who decided to build a protocol for how customers and suppliers can jointly share information and make decisions on forecasting and replenishment in a way that it benefits both sides. So the very first pilot actually started with Walmart and Warner-Lambert, a company that no longer exists. Some of those brands have been bought up by Johnson and Johnson and others. But the idea was to use data that both companies have and use them so that both companies can make better decisions. So it starts with a front-end agreement on here's what data which we plan to share and how it will be used and all of the protection of that data. Then you create a joint business plan, and then each side creates a sales forecast. If both the supplier and the customer have very similar forecast within a certain range, nothing happens.
- If, however, there is an exception, let's say the customer has a much higher forecast than the supplier or vice versa, then both companies get a pink that they have to resolve an exception. And then they talk about why do we see demand going higher or why do we see it going lower? And there they work through those issues. Then they create an order forecast based on that agreed upon demand. And at the back-end if there were exceptions for that order forecast. So that's, order wasn't fulfilled properly. Then there's another prompt for the two companies to talk to each other and that gets resolved and then the order gets generated.
- So it's a way for companies to get prompted to discuss discrepancies if those discrepancies exist. If companies are pretty closely aligned, then it's just business as usual but that's the general idea behind CPFR. It became very popular with some companies and I believe a lot of companies are still using this with some of their closest suppliers because it does require a lot of trust to share information such as, here's what my forecast is for example. So you want to be a little bit careful with that. But generally, this has yielded pretty positive results in terms of how companies are able to reduce inventory and improve service quality. So it's generally a good thing, but it's not easy to implement and it requires extra work. So it's not necessarily something that you'll try to do with all of your suppliers.

## Blockchain

<img width="1919" height="1023" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28c7721b-69bd-4f25-ad93-20b62ee1d2bc" />

- Now let's talk about a topic that has been in the news a lot recently, and probably will continue to be in the news, that's Blockchain. Blockchain is one of those overall terms that people probably have read about. I don't know how many of you have deep knowledge of it, and maybe everything I tell you about it is already well known to you, but let's make sure everybody's on the same page about it. So what is a Blockchain? So in general, it is categorized as a distributed ledger system. So, the best way to think about it is it's not just having one piece of paper, but information would be spread over multiple pieces of paper, and you have to put these pieces of paper, and let's go very simple, in the correct order in which they belong to, to see the meaningful information. So information is spread over multiple systems, and they are connected together by basically what we call the Blockchain.
- So it's not unlike a distributed database which allowed people to rather than have everything, and each record was its own. You could create your new record by combining things together from multiple spreadsheets. That's what blockchain is more akin to. The other thing about the blockchain is it tracks changes to the state of data assets. So, as you make a change in one place, that change is tracked, and you can see what changes were made to different pieces of data.. Probably the biggest strength of this is that it required consensus validation, validation from multiple parties to approve transactions. So you cannot initiate a transaction unless the other party agrees to it.
- The code that automates the flows, and exchanges of data, that's basically at the core of the block chain. That's why one of the key things that people have talked about, and why the Blockchain is important is that you can construct what's known as smart contracts, contracts that will allow transactions to go through only if certain conditions are met. Those don't have to be monitored actively by somebody, but they're built into the Blockchain. So the transaction requires certain approvals, and those approvals are not done, or certain things to happen, then it just will not allow the transaction to happen. That's probably the strongest feature of Blockchain as it relates to supply chain, it doesn't involve as much human interaction as other types of systems would use. So the advantages are Blockchain is outside of the four walls of the company. It also is a step towards entrant transparency because the Blockchain itself can be public, and it can have privacy features built in.
- But everybody who's on the Blockchain has visibility into it. So you get more transparency into the supply chain. Data's real-time, up-to-date, and synchronized. A lot of procurement organizations are very interested in seeing how Blockchain can help them. That's sort of the one part where I've heard a lot of people talking about it, and where a lot of people are excited about it. The barriers, it's obviously a very new technology. We don't necessarily understand every iteration of it.
- Also, we don't know what we can build with Blockchains yet fully. We might have some ideas, but a lot of things are still to be invented. Also, how efficient is it in terms of how it updates data? That remains to be seen. Probably the biggest barrier is how willing are the participants to actually open up their data and share it? So usually whenever you have systems that require you to share data, there's also some push back from different organizations who are not comfortable sharing all that much data, even if it's in everybody's best interest. Sometimes organizations are very wary of sharing data.

## Blockchain technology for supply chains—A must or a maybe?

This article is a couple of years old, but it is interesting to see how experts evaluated the potential of the technology back then and how it played out since then:

## Cryptocurrencies

<img width="1914" height="933" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af072d90-eaee-4b6f-a1b2-f968f9a3d244" />

- So now let's talk about Cryptocurrencies which is an application of Blockchain technology. Blockchain is the generic term, cryptocurrencies is one example of what you could possibly do with a Blockchain. Most probably believe that Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency but did a little bit of research and actually was way earlier, and 1983 there was a system called Ecash that was invented and it used Blockchain type technology. Maybe it wasn't as sophisticated as Bitcoin and didn't have the rules that Bitcoin has in place, but that was the first known digital cryptocurrency. Then in 1993, there was another version called Digicash which evolved into bit gold in 1998 and then there was really no significant work until Bitcoin came along in 2009. Probably took about 3-5 years for Bitcoin to really become very popular. In 2015, an improved version, if you will, of Bitcoin came up which is called Etherium.

<img width="1919" height="916" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6024554e-f211-4031-a396-e6b317ab03c6" />

- There's a lot of work on that as a cryptocurrency. So those are the major systems that really came up and probably Bitcoin and Etherium are the two that really popularized this whole cryptocurrency movement. So what are they? Well they are digital assets. They're not physical pieces of paper or coins, but they are digital assets, and they can be used as a medium of exchange. By that is they can be used like money. They rely on strong cryptography to make the whole system secure.
- So they allow for secure financial transaction. They also control how much currency is available in the system in general. They also verify that the assets have been transferred. Their strong feature is that there's decentralized control over it, and there's not one party that can control of either create more units or invalidate transaction. Everything is decentralized, which means that there's control but that control does not lie with just one party. So that makes it more attractive for certain types of things.

## Supply Chain Applications of Blockchain

<img width="1919" height="931" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcdf1ca1-7a23-4971-8cc4-c6fb5907bdf0" />

- So now let's talk about supply chain applications of blockchain. And I'll go through a couple of different areas. One is the first one, and probably the most important one is procurement. So this whole idea of smart contract that include the terms and conditions, how the contract is supposed to be executed with specific instructions. The processing logic and the visibility into multiple tiers is what makes smart contracts based on blockchain technology very attractive. So those are the main features that you would get with a smart contract based on blockchain that you wouldn't necessarily or easily have with other types of technology. Could you have set up a procurement system that does all of those things?

<img width="1918" height="945" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/789685be-5ace-444c-aac9-d6f98b2d6955" />

- Yes, you could but it probably wouldn't be as simple as easy and easy as using blockchain. Now in manufacturing, there's an interesting movement about how products that are being produced get track sort of in the digital world. So each asset that were working on has an identity. Maybe it's a skew or it's becoming a skew and new blocks of information can be created as this acid moves through the supply chain. And we have information that we can attach to that each stage. So you can see sort of when was this, not only manufactured but when was it on each specific machine. How long did it spent at each machine?

<img width="1919" height="930" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cae293b-9362-49a2-a1c5-22183a8fe440" />

- Whether when did it move to the next stage in the production process and so and so. Through blockchain, you actually can create very detailed data tracking for each product, each unique product that was produced. Not just the type, the generic SKU, it goes beyond that because each product has its unique identifier. Now, as you think about just tracking information from one specific asset, now you produce hundreds or thousands of those it becomes a lot of data but that's really what manufacturing is evolving to today. And finally on logistics, you can do electronic bills of ladings. You have a very clear origin of where the products came from, who produced them and it allows you much more detailed tracking and tracing of the products as they move through the supply chain. So that's the main advantage of blockchain technology in logistics.

## The Next Frontier in Technology

<img width="1919" height="937" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90238d89-4050-4f4c-bf59-123a64ec0749" />

- So now, let's move over to a different area of IT and that has to do with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Let me first define what artificial intelligence means. So artificial intelligence means that you program a computer to do one of these things that you see here on this slide. Could be reasoning. So logical steps of coming up with a certain decision. It can represent knowledge. It can be used to do planning.
- So if you need to accomplish this goal, how do you get there? Sort of backtrack. You can train them to learn, you can train them to process natural language. So by speaking to it or having written texts, it understands what that text is supposed to represent. So rather than computer programming language, you let them process natural language, and you can try to make them perceive stuff. So where things are not directly spelled out, you can fill in different pieces of information and infer from them. So what is machine learning?

<img width="1919" height="940" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5e40322-7431-43a9-8833-d683199f76e6" />

- Machine learning is generally a mathematical model where you have input data, train them to do certain tasks at the end. So you don't necessarily tell them, if A then B, but you give them data and sometimes you are giving them with results that other basically humans did before, and you let them figure out the model of how to take in the data and arrive at certain outcomes independently. So there are two types of learning that we're typically looking at. One is supervised learning where you give them, here's the data, here is how I want you to make decisions, here sample decisions that somebody may be for and you run them through that training data or you have unsupervised learning. That doesn't necessarily give them the answer but it lets the system figure out the answer, which is a lot harder to do but also more and more powerful because you don't need to train it in just the same way or you train it to recognize certain features. So I'm pretty sure that facial recognition software accomplishes that, or you use machine learning to detect anomalies and that's when you think that your credit card company is flagging a certain transaction as fraud. That's basically what's behind that.
- It's machine learning algorithm that knows what your usual patterns are using your credit card and now it's detects an unusual pattern and all of a sudden flags it. If you say no, this was a transaction I intended to make, then it actually uses that data to train itself and not detect the same anomaly the next time. So it's actually pretty neat.

## AI Background

- How can companies apply artificial intelligence to the supply chain? The general question is, what is our data? Is it mostly junk, or is there some gold in there? Usually, the gold is hidden in a whole pile of junk, so you have to be very careful. Not just careful, but it just takes a lot of time. If we can have artificial intelligence, we have systems that take care of our data and dig out the gold, that is a lot of time saved, that is a lot of money saved, and that's time that somebody gets freed up to do more meaningful things rather than digging through data and making sure that it is usable. If I were to guess what kind of systems could be replaced by more artificial intelligent driven platform, I would probably say S&OP systems, especially, since S&OP mainly is trying to match up forecasts with capacity planning.

<img width="1919" height="914" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13c07d7b-cada-43cd-ad7c-863c8d4fb237" />

- Usually, a fairly clear answer you could program a machine to build that consensus without human intervention, I think that's fairly possible. MRP type system can have, and probably to a large extent have artificial intelligence built into them as planning and scheduling system, therapy system, warehouse management system, TMS. The better ones all have some component of optimizations or trying to make things more efficient, and I think that trend will continue into the future. I think one interesting one is how customer relationship management system can use artificial intelligence when you have them build in new types of initiatives that are really driven by the data, and that's probably pushing the edge of what's possible today. But it would definitely be interesting to see because a lot of marketing has to do with creativity. If we can try to program creativity into systems, that would actually be very, very interesting. One example that I have, and this is a slide or this is a graphic that I took from an IBM ad, and that has everything that IBM contributes to the supply chain.
- A lot of what they do has to do with artificial intelligence and making things better. There's a supply chain business network which includes the customers and suppliers. There are intelligence services which take in data from multiple areas and try to make sense of them. Then there is supplier management, inventory management, and order management that are the main applications. Then you have the control tower. Control tower is one of those things that IBM is very strong on, where they try to give you this bird's eye view of what is going on in your supply chain, and alerting you to things that could go wrong. There's a lot of different things that are built into them, especially when you go into the third-party applications where the IBM basically has the platform that does the basic things, and as companies want to expand, they can actually use third parties to achieve certain specific tasks.
- So that's very interesting to me, how they look at it as, yes, we provide you with a solution, but we also allow third parties to come in and do additional things that we didn't think of doing.

- Okay, so there are different types of applications of machine learning that can be useful in a supply chain, and I'll talk about some of those. And one of them is around demand planning, and as I mentioned in an earlier lecture, if you get the demand plan right then everything else is so much better in the supply chain. So when you think of the general idea of what demand planning involves is you have data, you put a model onto that data and it produces a forecast. Maybe we can train machines to recognize models that are better than what humans could do. Another area would be in other types of logistics and processes such as inventory. Can we automate how we store inventory and how we treat inventory in a certain way that is more efficient? Same with managing transportation.

- Can we let a machine make decisions on what order goes on which truck from A to B and in what allotment? And then finally also warehousing. Can we direct our resources within the warehouse to work more efficiently by learning from past data, building new processes based on how well those past processes did and come up with new processes? That's ultimately what we're trying to do with machine learning, is to take in data, apply new models, and come up with better decisions.

- So now let me just try to make some predictions on the future of both artificial intelligence and machine learning. And maybe give you some sense of where this could lead to. And one of the things that both artificial intelligence, and machine learning can help with is this general term of analytics. Now that there are a whole host of different analytics, things that you could apply to supply chain. However, I'll just focus on sort of the most important ones. And there is a hierarchy in here. And as the capability of AI and machine learning evolved, I think you can get into the higher levels of analytics.
- So let's start off with descriptive analytics, and that's just sort of training your machines to tell you what the data has in store. It's really just telling you here's what this broadly looks like. In other words, it's taking the vast amount of data and it gives you a summary of what has happened. In the next level is diagnostic, trying to find, or possibly there are some issues. Level beyond that is predictive analytics. So that's roughly where a forecast would come in based on the patterns in the data. This is what I think will happen.
- The level beyond that is not only giving somebody the forecast, but also telling them how to execute it. So it's based on the forecast, we think you're going to sell a hundred unit. You should buy this much raw material, you should build this much product. You should hold that inventory in these locations. And that's how I think, sales of that SK you will go, and this is what you should do about it. And then finally, the highest level would be completely autonomous. Basically get all the data in, and it will automatically make decisions on, I'm going to buy this much.
- I'm going to manufacture this much, I'm going to hold this much inventory here. And there's really no human involvement at that point in making any of these decisions. So, that would be the highest level of using AI in machine learning within the supply chain.
