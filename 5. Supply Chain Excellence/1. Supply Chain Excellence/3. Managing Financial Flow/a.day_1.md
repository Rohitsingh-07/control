## Managing Financial Flow

- Welcome to the third course in our sequence. As we talked earlier about the flow of products and the flow of information, now we finally get to talk about the financial flow in the supply chain. The general idea is that the supply chain is a network of companies from customers and consumers all the way to initial suppliers, and all of the products flow towards the consumer, and information flows both ways. Now, when we think about the flow of finances, it works the opposite way that products flow. As we think about how to structure this network of customers and suppliers, the way money flows becomes an important consideration, and somewhat actually say that the flow of finances dictates how the supply chain looks like. Because ultimately, the problem that we're trying to solve has to do with how do we extract more profit out of this supply chain. So the flow of products has an immense influence on the shape of the supply chain.

- That's why we structured this certificate program in such a way that we focus first on the flow of products, then we focus on the flow of information, and then lastly, we focus on the flow of finances. Now when we think about what the goal in terms of finances is, we are getting money in from our customers, we're doing things with money as we operate our own organization, and then we send some money to our suppliers, and that keeps the supply chain going. The flow of products works the opposite way, products flow from suppliers all the way through to our customers. That is what we have to keep in mind with financial flow, it flows opposite of product flow.

## What is Financial Flow?

<img width="1919" height="939" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/095fb2c6-f683-47e4-ba21-338db6ff2678" />

- So now let's define what is the financial flow. Well, how do we see it in the supply chain? What does it make up? When we think about where does money come into the organization, in the simplest form, customers are paying us money for the products we sell them, and we pay suppliers money for the products that they're sending us, and that's the inflow and outflow of money within the supply chain, or at least how we perceive the borders of the supply chain, and we can influence how money comes into our company and how money goes out of our company by setting certain policies, and a lot of that we'll discuss later on in this course. What you have to realize is that this is not a random process. The way we get money in from our customers is not random, nor the way we send money to our suppliers. Now, in many cases, companies have treated it as two independent problems, but we'll discover how these things are interlinked and how they actually make a difference on how the supply chain is structured.

<img width="1914" height="934" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df0b506a-7dcb-4375-babd-11860d212a47" />

- Why else does it matter? Well, there are three financial documents that every company has to keep. One is the balance sheet, the other one is the income statement, and the third one is the cash flow statement. Those are known as the essential financial statements of the company. They're actually even published for publicly traded companies, and what is written into those is going to describe the financial performance of a company. So as you are evaluating a company or if you're comparing companies, you can use these three documents to figure out whether the company made any money, how much money they made, maybe draw implications on what will happen to this company financially in the future. So we're going to spend some time on these arguments in the beginning of the course, and then we'll refer to that as we go throughout this course.
- So the other important takeaway is that we want to understand how supply chain management contributes to the financial standing of the company. How can we help influence the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement and make them better through good supply chain management? That will be the specific goal of this course and why we are actually spending time on finance in a supply chain management course.

## Supply Chain Financing

- Now I'll tell you a little back history on this term, supply chain financing. It was only a couple of years ago that I sat around the conference room table with a couple of my colleagues and we pontificate against, professors sometimes do. We thought about different areas that are touched by supply chain management. One of those areas was finance. Finance and supply chain management typically don't mix too closely. Supply chain management and IT does, supply chain management and marketing sometimes does, but not finance as much. One of the things that came out of it was a research program.
- So a lot of what I will talk about in this course is stuff that we developed here at Rutgers over the course of a couple of years. The combination of that is a book that we published, and it's termed, Supply Chain Financing. So a lot of the things that you'll learn are going to be covered in the book. I'm not saying buy the book, but if you're interested in learning more, here's my little advertisement. So when we thought about covering this research topic of supply chain financing, what we first had to do was to come up with a definition. Here's our definition. So supply chain financing is: using the supply chain to fund the organization, and using the organization to fund the supply chain.

<img width="1919" height="952" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6da9aad-15fc-449d-ba8d-6ae6ac608afc" />

- The idea that you can draw funding into the organization through your supply chain and that you can use funding within the supply chain that you draw from your organization, is the key thing that we're trying to get across. It's not a one-way street, it's definitely not something that has to be adversarial, but you can use it in a way to benefit the supply chain.

## Financial Statements

<img width="1919" height="880" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccc61014-22eb-466b-ba34-b23e59430930" />

- So let's talk about the financial statements. The three key financial statements are the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. And let me just give you a brief definition of what these three statements are doing. So the balance sheet, sometimes it's also known as the statement of financial position. It tells us the financial condition of the company, what stuff does it have and who owns that stuff? And stuff in financial terms are called assets and who owns it is made up by the difference between liability and equities. Liabilities are money that we owe to somebody else and whatever is left over is called equity.

<img width="1919" height="937" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1db857c3-ce8d-4208-b723-6e25fed371d3" />

- So if your assets are as much as you liability, then mathematically if you look at the formula, there's really nothing left for equity to do, so it has to be zero. And if you have zero equity, you really don't own anything even though you have a bunch of assets. So you have to always make sure the two sides are in balance, the assets and the liabilities plus equity side, but it also tells you a lot about how the company is standing from a financial perspective. So if you have a lot of of stuff, but you don't really own it, then that tells us something. Or if you have a lot of stuff and you own most or all of it, and there are no liabilities, that tells us also something. Now, the income statement is a different type of view at the company. We are looking at profit or hopefully no loss and it tells us whether the firm made any money.

<img width="1919" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a231a783-5250-4c4e-8272-113d1a7cf120" />

<img width="1919" height="925" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e2b2658-e68d-4d57-b3f5-0a6e6fbf3160" />

- So it looks as at revenues minus expenses and whatever is left over, we sometimes call profit, other times we call earnings, but the key thing is to look whether in a certain time period, we made any money. And then the last one is the cash flow statement. And in many ways, the cash flow statement is the bridge between the income statement and the balance sheet. So when you think about what it tells us is it looks at our cash balance and it tells us where is money from and where is it going, so sources and uses of cash. And the ultimate bottom line, the ultimate message that it tells us is, what was the change in cash?

## The Balance Sheet

<img width="1919" height="932" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f3c850b-8c28-4736-9808-4c34e3dff942" />

- Now, let's talk about the balance sheet in some detail. Here's an example of a simple balance sheet. On the left-hand side, you see assets; on the right-hand side, you'll see liabilities and equity. When we look at the different positions on the balance sheet, they're always ordered in the same way. If you take any company, any publicly traded company, you can access their balance sheet and history of balance sheet all the way back. You see the asset side always starts with cash, and then the next main position is accounts receivable, the one after that is inventory, then prepaid expenses, and it's always in that order. Now, if we look at general categories, the first category is called current assets.
- Current assets are typically assets that are either cash or can be converted into cash within one year. So those are the short-term assets of the company. Then after that, on the asset side, we have the opposite of short-term assets, long-term assets. So the large category of that would be PP&E, plant, property, and equipment. Those are, obviously, all the land that the company has, all of the buildings that are built on top of that land and everything that goes inside of those buildings, plus other long-term assets that a company may have. So it could be assets that cannot be converted into cash within a year, so anything that's long-term would be listed under there. As the name implies, balance sheet, the total number of assets and the total number of liabilities and equity has to match.
- So there has to be a balance between those two sides. Then with liabilities, we follow the same logic. So we have short-term liability debt that has to be paid back within a year. Then we have accounts payable, money we owe to our suppliers. Accrued expenses, all of those is our charges that we have to pay back within a year and those are also categorized as current liabilities. Then we have other liabilities which are longer term. Finally, we have common equity, just basically the money that the owners of the company or the shareholders of the company, if it's publicly traded, own.

<img width="1909" height="838" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df9672bb-c0cc-4dc0-a5ea-211501c502ea" />

- Those two sides, as I mentioned, have to balance each other out. So assets has to equal liabilities plus equity. When you look at the balance sheet, one of the key things that you have to realize is that it has something very important. A balance sheet is a statement done on a specific day and the date of the balance sheet is very, very critical. Because when you think about evaluating a company, it doesn't matter as much what a balance sheet says on a certain date, but the trajectory, and the history, and the future predictions we can draw off of that balance sheet matter more. So the changes in equity, the changes in assets, and the changes in liabilities are what really is important. Ultimately, we want to see what is the change in equity from one period to the next and hopefully going forward.
- So that's the key thing. So when you see this formula, the Greek letters just mean the changes in equity, the changes in assets minus the changes in liability. So just having one balance sheet is not going to tell you that much, it's just a snapshot of a firm's financial condition and without some context, it's not going to necessarily tell you that much. It tells you a little bit of something, but you'd like to see a history. How did the balance sheet develop over time and how does it look compared to other companies that we can compare this firm to? So timing is very important and an overall comparison of the industry is also important. For example, if you look at a picture of you when you're two years old, it probably resembles you, but it's not a picture of you today and you can't realy tell how you developed. So the date is important and having more than one balance sheet is also important.
