## Inbound Information Flow (Intro)

<img width="1919" height="944" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea254882-d513-4baa-a693-aa88c0bfcf2d" />

- Now let's look at inbound information flow. So the type of data and information that we get in from our suppliers. Generally, we can classify the information we get from our suppliers as inventory information, so how much inventory do they have, confirming orders, and then shipping. That's generally what we care about for the functioning of the supply chain. Yes, of course, they'll send us invoices too. But for the functioning of the supply chain, we need to know, or usually we want to know how much inventory do we have. When we place an order, yes, that they receive it, do they plan to ship it, and then shipping information once it actually happened.
- Although this looks fairly simple, within this framework, we have to be able to recognize patterns that affect how we work with that supplier in a more broad way. So even though this looks very simple, this is hundreds and thousands of pieces of information and transmissions that we get. So it looks very simple, but there's a lot of data behind that.

## P2P Systems

<img width="1919" height="968" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aa32f03-b349-4afd-8c03-7fa3710203e3" />

- So one of the key systems that we use to work with our suppliers are called procure-to-pay systems. What they do is they handle the IT sever, the information side of that supplier relationship. You'll see that it includes several steps that refer to the how the goods are moving, and then you also see how the money is moving. The money part, I'm going to show it to you because that's often a very important part of what is included in these P2P systems. However, we're going to talk about the intricacies and course number 3, which I'm very excited about, but let's look at the physical side of the goods. So within a procure-to-pay system, you have your whole catalog of SKUs that you typically buy. In addition, you also have the suppliers that you could possibly buy from.
- Sometimes an SKU just exist for one suppliers, sometimes you can buy from multiple suppliers and might also be rules on how to pick suppliers based on the SKU that you're looking at. Maybe you have a preferred choice and then a back-up choice and a back-up choice behind that. Now, then within the procured pay system, you can request goods, you may either send them a purchase order, which that is done for the majority of items or if it's something very small or from a source. We typically don't buy from, you can actually do the payment part up front by basically using a credit card. If you send a PO, then one supplier receives that, they can send you an invoice, you can approve that invoice within the system. You can also receive the goods, so you get a physical receipt of the goods in one of your warehouses, but the P2P system will also track it electronically. Then once you receive the goods, you can also post the payment, once that invoice has been approved and the item has been paid and there's obviously documentation and analytics and reporting for everything that's built into this type of system.
- But that's typically what a procure-to-pay system is. Now, let me also say that it's probably one of those categories and in a certain way, a procure-to-pay system may exist within an ERP system. However, it is also one of the fastest growing standalone categories of supply chain system. So there's a lot of different vendors of these systems and a lot of companies are starting to move away from the building capabilities of their ERP system, going to what's known as best-of-breed system, so there's a tremendous growth in that category.

## Everything you should look for in a P2P solution

The following is a nice overview of what procure to pay systems are and how they work:

## P2P Benefits

<img width="1919" height="936" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/610da5da-da46-4142-91e3-a83a372ca5c5" />

- Now, let me talk about the benefits of procure-to-pay systems and let me first say that it allows companies to manage their suppliers in a more objective way. Because you put all of your different suppliers in there and and then you can also treat them a little bit more careful. And it doesn't depend on just one buyer and how they manage a certain supplier. It really is sort of a more precisely managed process. However, where it becomes more interesting in is that when you do one of these typical supplier categorizations were some of your suppliers are strategic. And you treat them differently from your routine suppliers and you have some bottleneck suppliers, which posed a higher risk, and leverage suppliers that you want to deal with in a different way. A procure-to-pay system is going to allow you to treat all of these different supplier categories differently.

- And that is going to make it easier for all of your procurement agents to follow this general strategy and interact with each supplier in a way in which they're supposed to interact with them. So if you;re supposed to give most of your business to certain suppliers because you get a better mix of discount and innovation and other things. They help you in different ways, then a P2P system will automatically track orders to the right supplier. And you don't have somebody who could possibly override it by just mistake. So it helps you control your business pretty well. It structures the procurement process. The whole workflow is then also digitalized, which makes it easier to track and see what people did.
- And it also creates efficiencies because you have less paper, less email, and everything works through the system, and it's a much more objective process. So there's some good benefits about it.

## P2P Challenges

<img width="1919" height="898" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33f2ee89-af85-4ca2-9ab8-6d265cab2610" />

- As with a lot of things, there are also some challenges that you face when money have procure-to-pay system. One of them has to do with process management. One of my mentors in supply chain management always like to say that structure drives behavior, but behavior doesn't drive structure. So when you set in place a certain workflow, and it actually helps to set that workflow in the digital side of the activity, then your driving behavior, because people have to work within that certain information workflow. Whereas if you don't necessarily have an electronic workflow that people have to follow, then their behavior might be anything however they see fit, and sometimes it is effective, other times it's not that effective. So it's a very interesting view from an organizational perspective, whether you want people to work in a certain way or are you just let them do whatever they want? If you have certain people, maybe it's best to let them do whatever they want because their efficiency minded and they'll find the best way.

<img width="1919" height="929" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26821cce-8add-4e3f-a4d3-f84b8b1a2b65" />

- But a lot of organizations are moving towards, "Hey, we want people to do things a certain way because not only is that more efficient, but it also creates consistency." So the process management is not that simple because when you implement one of these IT systems and it changes the way things were done. A lot of people are going to be uncomfortable, and how do you manage that transition? Now there's a new workflow, and I have to do it in a different way, and I'm used to the old way and all of that has to be managed. I'm not saying it's impossible to make that change, but it's not that easy. Also, resources, you probably have to spend as much time on a procure-to-pay system as you would spend on an ERP modules. So months, maybe a year, several dozens of people, millions of dollars in costs.
- Now there also are, I should say, procure-to-pay systems which are more Cloud based and that implementation works a lot easier, but there's still some customization and adaptation to make them work. So there's some variability and how much resources you need in all of this.
