## Raw Material Inventories

- Now let's talk about inbound product flow. So when we think about inbound product flow, it's the products that are coming into our operations from our suppliers. And the first topic I would like to cover is raw materials inventory. Those are exactly the parts assemblies, raw materials that we get from our suppliers. So those are the things that are required to manufacture products. We buy them from our suppliers, and then raw materials get converted into work in process once we start working on them, and when we're done working on them, they become finished goods. So it's always that sequence.

<img width="1919" height="891" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/362f6751-5f79-44ed-98ab-baa6c6ee78a4" />

- So so those are things that we store and we're getting ready to to use in our manufacturing. The goals for raw material is obviously to support manufacturing. You want to make sure that plenty of raw materials are available for you to build your product. It is a big risk management tool, because as we talked about in the risk section before, we want to avoid disruptions, but if disruptions happen, the more raw material inventory we have the bigger the buffer. It gives us time to recover or find alternative ways to obtain these raw materials. And then, finally, it supports customer service. Once our products are built, whatever internal disruptions we could have had by lack of inventory are being avoided.
- So we want to make sure those three goals are met by managing our raw materials inventory as good as possible. On the other hand, of course, we don't want to have too much of it because inventory is costly and you need a place to store it. So it's not a free-for-all necessarily.

## Inventory Coordination

<img width="1919" height="957" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e237fc50-6e91-4911-8ae2-fb5927645214" />

- So next, let's talk about inventory coordination, and that's an interesting discussion because what our suppliers view as their finished goods becomes our raw materials. Then once we start using it, it becomes our work in process. So one important question to ask is how much of each category should you hold? How much finished goods should your supplier hold? How much raw materials do you hold? Then how much the consequences of that goes into work in process. Now, the real answer depends on a lot of factors, but let's say you have a Lean focus so internally you can accomplish that.

<img width="1919" height="912" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2743c9a-dbdd-48de-bced-bf3788821a0a" />

- You're going to have very little work in process, very little raw materials and you'll ask your suppliers to replenish you very quickly. Now, in that scenario of course your suppliers inventory probably has to go up because they can't really afford to be lean themselves. Ideally, they should try to be, but that's not always possible so most often when you have a Lean approach, suppliers are ending to hold more inventory and that might actually be a good thing because they might be better prepared to hold that inventory but that's not always a given. So these trade-offs can be very tricky to manage. Now the question of who should hold the inventory, the supplier or the buyer, has real discussion and often buyers and suppliers will argue over who should hold more of the inventory. I'm showing you here a couple of reasons for each one to hold inventory. So on the buyer side, for example, well, if they already hold it, it's available.
- So there's no question about a supplier not delivering on time. You don't put yourself into that risks so it is a risk mitigation strategy and even if they have a disruption, you don't necessarily feel it as much if you have plenty of raw materials inventory. On the pro for the supplier, it might be cheaper for the supplier to hold raw materials or in their case they would call it finished goods for them, because it's worthless and a lot of the inventory costs comes from just the money tied up in the inventory and there is also flexibility involved. If they hold the inventory and they have multiple customers, it can go to multiple customers, it's not tied up with this one customer who may or may not use it. Then finally by holding more inventory, they'll be able to give you a higher service level because they can supply you very quickly, then very unlikely that they stock out and all of these other service type factors. So it's an interesting discussion and usually it comes down to is the buyer willing to pay a slightly higher price to the supplier for them to hold more and more inventory and have it ready for them and if they're not, then probably to have that same level service you just have to hold more inventory yourself. So it's an interesting discussion usually.

## Inventory Coordination Tradeoffs

Then once we start using it it becomes our work in process. So one important question to ask is how much of each category should you hold? How much finished goods should your supplier hold?

## Vendor Managed Inventory

<img width="1919" height="955" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07af2527-27c6-4947-8a1b-779955d0d72d" />

- Now let's talk about vendor managed inventory. And vendor managed inventory is this strategy where a vendor receives visibility into their customers system so they know how much of let's in this case raw materials inventory. Let's assume the customer is a manufacturer. So how much raw material inventory that customer is holding and and possibly even some kind of a forecast for the products that are being built. And then the vendor and customer both agree on a certain service level. And the vendor then has complete autonomy in determining when to replenish their customer because they obviously know what is going on in the customer facility and they know their own restrictions. And when it comes time to replenish inventory, they can freely plan out when the customer's going to get replenished.

<img width="1919" height="914" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/480446ac-aa0b-40c6-8490-57d03e6887cc" />

- The advantages of vendor managed inventory is that typically you achieve the same service level or even a better service level with less inventory because now the supplier has visibility. They don't really need to carry extra inventory for uncertainty because uncertainty overall has been reduced. This approach doesn't come without disadvantaging. One of them is the the customer loses control over their delivery. So all of a sudden delivery will happen and you're like okay, I guess I need more replenishment. Also it has to do with the integrity of the customers' data now you're opening it up to supplier. So if you are entering into one of these agreements, you have to make sure that you trust this supplier and to really treat your data with confidence.
- And then finally it comes down to privacy because if all of a sudden the customer learns about different things that are happening in your business they might be able to take advantage of that information. That's usually a worry that a lot of customers are having. So it's not typically something that every supplier will get to do for, for a customer. But I've seen some very good applications of it.

## Supplier Quality

<img width="1919" height="975" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91841f72-81fd-42f2-bd8b-233b7b859f9a" />

- Now, let's talk about supplier quality. So when we think about supplier quality in general, there are multiple dimensions of what of what is important when it comes to how how good the quality of a supplier is. And I'll start with the most obvious one and that's the Product Quality. So it says the specifications of the product that you're buying or sub-assembly or whatever you're buying. It's the materials they use, I mean sometimes even within specification so a supplier can choose different levels of materials and some might perform better than others. So it really comes down to multiple factors. The second dimension would be Service Quality, that has to do with the delivery of the product and the support you receive after you buy the product.
- And then the third dimension of supplier quality, I like to call Relational Quality. And that has to do with how well of a working relationship that we have with these suppliers. Typically you don't do that with every supplier, inly your top most important supplier are going to have some kind of a closer relationship or some kind of integration that you build with each other. But as you move to those few top suppliers, it becomes something very important. Because if you can't necessarily collaborate very well it's going to be hard hard to really achieve a good working relationship and it's going to be hard to be aligned on the important issues for both companies.

## A Culture of Quality Through Supplier Quality Management

The  relationship between quality management and other functions is one of  the most mutually beneficial relationships in business. Supplier quality  management can improve operational and financial metrics.

## Raw Materials Quality

<img width="1919" height="940" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18850139-2aaf-49e9-8ebf-e2484b954b1d" />

- Now let's focus in on just the raw materials quality, and when it comes to quality factors there are really two sides of it. One is the quality of design, so what materials did the supplier pick how, much tolerance do you have in the specifications, and how well do those products perform? And then on the other side, we have quality of conformance, so how consistent is it, if there is variation, how big is that variation, and how likely it is that the supplier or you detect issues in quality and remedy them? So quality really, to me, has to two different sides, one is the design side and one is the conformance side. So when it comes to how you deal with your suppliers, there's really three levels. One is inspection. You're not going to really get around inspecting products.

<img width="1919" height="916" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c37af2e-d5a3-4cc1-9fbb-77100ffaf2ba" />

- It is something that every company is going to have to do when it comes to raw materials that they receive from suppliers. Now if you find something, how do you get the supplier to fix those quality issues? And then finally, you want to keep some kind of a report or a file to see how suppliers stack up over time. And whether they're quality levels are really up to what your expectations were and what you agreed upon when you negotiated a supplier agreement with your supplier. So quality control is one of those important things that manages a lot of the interactions with a supplier.

## Service Quality

<img width="1919" height="944" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a321299e-dee4-4a3e-8888-0463abf98dee" />

- Now let's talk about service quality and service quality also has two parts. One is the logistics part and the other one is what often we would call customer support. So on the logistics side, it really is these logistics type of performance metric. How long is the lead time? What is the variation in lead time? So lead time being defined as the time from order submission to order receipt. How accurate is the supplier and filling orders?
- Those are typically, traditionally the top three metrics for delivery quality. So how far do I get my stuff? If there is a variation in time, how big is that variation, and how likely it is that if I ordered ten specific items, I get exactly those ten specific items in an order? So that's one part of service quality. The other side is customer support. How likely are my suppliers customer service people to recognize an issue? What kind of resolution can they accomplish, and then what kind of follow up to the do afterwards to make sure that everything gets fixed and everybody's happy.

<img width="1919" height="924" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0848a89-c2b2-48c2-8aa2-5e3428370aae" />

- How far do they go and to really ensuring that their customers are happy with the resolution? So when you monitor logistic service quality, it's typically one of those things where you want to collect data continuously. You want to have that type of information about your suppliers. You want to also recognize incidence and then communicate them to your suppliers to give them a chance to fix them. There's no use if you don't communicate these incidence because then they don't really get a chance to fix it. So it's really is a back and forth between you and the supplier, and insuring that quality is up to the level, and typically, it is something that before you enter into an agreement with a supplier, is something that you discussed and you agreed on a level of service quality that is good for both sides. So you want to make sure that you're transparent back to the supplier about whether they accomplish what they promised.

## Supplier Scorecards

<img width="1919" height="941" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07021f16-12b2-4955-a524-a0b68d26d123" />

- Now let's talk about suppliers scorecards. Supplier scorecards are one of those things that very often are used between a buyer and a supplier to measure performance in that buyer-supplier relationship. It depends on the relationship and who the parties involved are. But it could be quarterly or even monthly reports that are coming out or it can be some kind of a dashboard that gets continuously updated with meetings on a regular basis. So typically, everything gets built up into one number, one score and you have things like product quality, factors in there and product quality there might be a good dozen or so different metrics and they all get scored and the scores get average step into product quality, same as service quality, cost and typically seen as relative cost and risk factors. Most purchasing organizations are going to push their suppliers to deliver them a lot of these metrics. It could be that for example, they want to see financial information from their supplier, and the reasoning usually is hey, if you're in financial trouble, I need to know about it ahead of time.

<img width="1919" height="950" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4cfbabf-fd2a-4046-b38a-a1e440e8b317" />

- If I need to work on something or help you out in some ways, that's something that I want to know sooner rather than later. So it is a little bit of a back and forth, but it's also sort of a way for the supplier to know whether they accomplish all of the goals that they set out to accomplish with this specific customer. So it's a good way for both sides to communicate. Now when we look at metrics, it is one of those things where you have to first decide on the right set of metrics and then negotiate what level you are trying to accomplish, then you implement them. Then after they're implemented, you can monitor performance going forward.

## Supplier Segmentation

<img width="1919" height="950" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a66621f-03aa-4d7e-a886-049726a0d0fc" />

- So now let's wrap things up in terms of how we look at suppliers by talking about procurement excellence and specifically the topic of supplier segmentation. This is a very famous type of chart and it does go back many, many years ago when it was sort of determined that yes, companies have multiple suppliers. But not all suppliers are to be treated equal or looked at equal there. There's some that are more important due to various factors and some that are less important. So it's not just the more important versus less important, but there's different other factors involved. So this two by two matrix that you see here is very commonly used when we talk about supplier segmentation. The axis sometimes can change but we have on the bottom, we have potential to add value.
- And on the y axis, we have supply risk. We have the high and the low categories. So routine suppliers are low risk and have very little potential to add value. Those are the things that you have to have but there's really no, Way to make those suppliers stand out. You want to just buy from them, make sure they do their job, and not really have too much involvement with those types of suppliers. The simpler the interaction with the supplier, the better. On the extreme and then you have strategic suppliers, and strategic suppliers, there's typically very few of them.
- But they really make a difference to your business. So you want them to obviously be profitable, but they also provide you with a critical competitive advantage. They might even help you develop new products or components. So you want to make sure that they perform as well as possible and manage those relationships very closely. Then the the other two categories are bottleneck suppliers. And those are the ones where you might have issues and challenges or those are suppliers when you have very few alternatives available. So you have to really be careful with how you manage those because they carry high risk.
- So if any supplier that you're worried about, it's those bottleneck suppliers. And then finally, you have leverage suppliers and if you are able to extract more value out of those, they really make a difference to your bottom line. So if there are cost savings to be had, those might be very expensive raw materials that you're buying. Even small savings from those leverage suppliers are going to make a big difference to your financial so you have to be careful in managing them. But because of cost reasons mostly but you also don't want to add to risk. So if you have a low risk supplier, you want to keep in that way. Now when it comes to those four categories, you also want to remember that in terms of number of suppliers, the majority of them are routine suppliers.

<img width="1919" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbc365f7-c67a-42ee-8954-ab438b319bf3" />

- So typically we say about 50% of your supplier should be routine suppliers, but they account for only 25% or so or a smaller part of your spend. Then when we move to the leverage category, those could be on in let's say 25% of the suppliers, which are leverage suppliers. But they account for 40% of your spend so it's fewer suppliers, but you buy more of them. So this is your largest category in terms of spend. So that's why you if you're looking for cost savings, that's the category that you look for cost savings. Then bottleneck suppliers, there's very few of them and they don't account for that much of your spend overall, but that's where most of your risk lies in. And then strategic suppliers, you have very few of them.
- Typically no more than 10% of your supply should be strategic supplier, may be even less but they account for pretty large portion of your spend. So you want to manage them very carefully because those suppliers might help you with innovation. So those relationships go beyond just here I give you money, you give me products. So those are the four categories and that's typically how companies are splitting up their suppliers. Now, could there be in-betweens? Yes, and sometimes you need to determine how to divide up those categories that you kind of get roughly the correct number of suppliers in there. And then you're going to have one management approach to managing the relationships with each one of those categories.
- So everybody in the strategic side will sort of get treated similarly under that same framework.  the bottleneck suppliers will get treated differently from strategic suppliers, but similar to other bottleneck suppliers. So you'll determine your your approach accordingly.

## Supplier Relationship Management

<img width="1919" height="938" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b69f7b1-fcf4-4dbf-adfd-23229f4ab63a" />

- Now let's talk about supplier relationship management. So when we think of a system to manage relationships with suppliers,there's four steps that you would follow through. First one is to select, so you identify possible supplier, evaluate them, and then pick the ones that you are going to work with. Then once you pick them, you go through contracting phase. So you get a contract negotiated obviously, you go through the on-boarding, and then you maintain those contracts. Then you move into the monitor phase. So you monitor to make sure that performance is up to the level of your expectations.
- They comply with all of the rules and regulations that you have in addition to any government regulations, and you monitor risks of your suppliers. Then finally, you go into the develop phase if the situation warrants depending on the category they're in. So you might identify opportunities for improvement, determine how you're going to work through those improvement, and then verify that the performance has been improved. So these are the four steps that you go through with each supplier. Now, maybe for some routine supplier it's a very streamlined part, might never have the opportunities for improvement that you identify with though. Most likely you'll have the majority of those improvements with your strategic suppliers depending on what the opportunity would be. Maybe have a risk reduction strategy with your bottleneck suppliers or something of that kind.

<img width="1919" height="951" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea902190-980f-403e-ad5f-1eb593a9e018" />

- Now, before we finish this up, let me just give you my top favorite example of a strategic relationship. As you see, McDonald's and Coke are one of the best examples I can think of. So what makes that a great strategic relationship is the relative position in each of the two industries. So for example, McDonald's is the world's leading food service retailer, typically, the largest fast food chain in most of the markets they compete in, and Coke is one of the world's largest beverage companies. So they're at the top of each of their respective industries. It's not like you have a supplier that's very small with a large buyer or vice versa. They're both gigantic companies and they do things very well within their respective industry.
- Their relationship actually dates back to the 1950's. You see there are certain factors that really contribute to each other's success. One is exclusivity. With very, very few exceptions, you cannot buy Cokes competitor product in a McDonald's. Now there are there are some very few places where you can buy, let's say, a Pepsi product in a McDonald's, and those of you who can tell me where that happens in the next discussion posts, we're going to get at least some reputation bonus points. I can't give you any real points for that, but there are some few places where you can buy Pepsi in a McDonald's. But generally, Coke and Pepsi have exclusivity.
- So you're not going to find anything but Coke products in a McDonald's. Then going back to the history of both companies. As they started expanding internationally, both companies coordinated their international efforts. So when they pick the country, both companies went in there together. So obviously, you need Coke and your Mcdonald's in a foreign country, but also Coke used that as a launching point for their own introduction of Coca-Cola in that country. Then lastly, you have very close integration. So the way these two companies work together, the way the syrup is delivered into the dispensing machines in the McDonald's restaurant is very tightly coordinated, delivery schedules are synchronized, and so on.
- So it's a very close integrated supply chain relationships, and it continues to be a source of competitive advantage for both of these companies. Several years back Pepsi realized that they couldn't compete with that type of relationship and Pepsi actually went out and started buying fast food chains where they would have exclusivity over Coca-Cola in a way to balance the scales a little bit. That actually didn't go over that well and that division got spun off into Yum brands which is its own company now. It's interesting that when you follow this relationship it's definitely something that is mutually beneficial for both sides.
