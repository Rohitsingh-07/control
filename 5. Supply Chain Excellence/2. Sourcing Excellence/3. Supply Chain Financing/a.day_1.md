## Outbound Financial Flow

<img width="1919" height="955" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2295606b-f8f4-4abb-a395-6ccfa6728c13" />

- All right. Now let's talk about Outbound financial flow. So that's the money that we are pushing into our supply chain. In other words, the money that we're paying our suppliers. So when we look at the cycle of payments, we issue a purchase order to a supplier, then we receive an invoice from that supplier for that purchase order, then we receive the goods at some point, and the order might change a little bit in here. We approve the invoice and then we pay the invoice, and then we send out another PO, and so on. The key thing is that we have a certain number of days from the receipt of the invoice, until we have to pay it, and hopefully whatever payment term we agreed on, you receive the invoice, it tells you you have to pay with an X number of days.

<img width="1919" height="951" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc74c46f-4167-46bb-910a-23d88c82b1c4" />

- Actually, we pay the invoice within that time period. Sometimes that doesn't necessarily happen. So the idea is that payment terms are similar or are correlated with days payable outstanding because the longer the payment term, the more accounts payable we accrue. That number on the balance sheet just gets larger and larger. If you have shorter payment terms, you're not going to have that much accounts payable. If you've longer payment terms, you have more accounts payable. That's typically what we see with companies. So average payment terms are not exactly equal. Days payable outstanding. But they're correlated.

## Reducing the cash conversion cycle through effective working capital management

## DPO Extension

- So now let's talk about these days payable outstanding and how they evolved over time. So, one of the things that a lot of people have talked about is that companies are starting to extend their DPO. In other words, they try to make their payables larger. Another way of looking at it is that the payment terms, so the time between the receipt of the invoice and the actual payment is getting longer and longer. And some people have talked about it as this is necessary. And a lot of what we've seen was after the Great Recession of 2008. A lot of companies due to the fear of possibly not having liquidity, not having access to fund, they have started growing their cash positions.

<img width="1919" height="949" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ce52415-6f7e-44c2-b4f3-12989610706e" />

- In other words, they are trying to increase the amount of cash that they have as much as possible and DPO extension is one very quick and fairly cheap way of getting additional cash. I mean, you could get loans and then have extra cash. But if you extend your payables, then you don't have to pay any interest for that. And here's one example by Amazon. For example, we see in the early 2000, their days payable outstanding were around 40 to 50 and then the third quarter of 2019, it was 79. So we see a very deliberate increase in days payable outstanding and if I was going to show you other companies, we would see the same pattern. So, most companies are extending their payables, in other words, if you're a supplier to Amazon, you used to only have to wait 40 to 50 days, somewhere in there.
- And now you wait significantly longer. Remember, DPO does not mean average payment turn but they are related to each other. So, this is a measurable way of seeing, That or saying that these payable outstanding have increased. Now this actually became a significant enough issue that the White House stepped in and announced that they would ask large companies to not keep extending days payable outstanding. And the program was called supplier pay and it was an initiative meant to make sure that small businesses wouldn't take the brunt of these DPO extensions. Now, When we look at the result of supplier pay, a lot of large companies signed on to it. However, as you saw from the previous chart, if anything, that DPO extension trend has still continued.

<img width="1918" height="961" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2a34326-8f3f-4f11-acbb-cb6ce9877b39" />

- Now, we have to look at DPO extension in a slightly more nuanced perspective. And this is a typical way that most companies would segment their suppliers. So some suppliers are strategic and maybe they have higher supplier risk, but also very high potential to add value, others are bottleneck suppliers, they don't add much value. However, what the they do is there's a lot of supply risk involved and then when categories leverage suppliers, they add a lot of value but they're low risk and then routine suppliers everybody else, it's just a company that we buy a few items from and that's basically it. And if you think about these four categories, with some suppliers for example in the leverage category, those would be pretty good candidates to extend your payables. Whereas with the bottleneck supplier, you might want to be a little bit more careful.

## Payment Options

<img width="1919" height="944" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65f1995d-a3a1-4b82-8f3d-5b7bd792996d" />

- Let's talk about payment options. So when a company is paying their suppliers, what are different ways of sending the money to them? Well, in the United States at least there's still a good number of bills that are paid by check. So it's a paper check that is mail from one company to the next and they open the check and give it to their bank and the money flows electronically. Well, another way would be to use an electronic method of payment which is known as ACH or wire transfer. Third category would be to use a credit card and a fourth one which we'll discuss later on is termed supply chain finance and I'll discuss what all of these mean in some details. So checks, this is what the US check typically looks like.

<img width="1919" height="941" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/269981cc-a170-42e2-a889-1607890921ed" />

- About five percent of all companies are still using it and it's a universally accepted method of payment in the United States and you don't see it very frequently today, but sometimes people are paying their grocery bill at a supermarket with the check which is usually very annoying for the people after them, but it is a generally accepted method of payment. Internationally though, I wouldn't try to send US checks internationally, that typically doesn't work. Now, why do some companies use this? Well, one has to do with they've always done that and they didn't switch over to electronic methods. But there's also a delays, so you send the check in the mail and it takes a couple days and then until it gets open, till the bank receives it and the money gets moved, that's a good week. So some companies may like it because they can say they paid something on time, but the money really gets moved a week later. Electronic payments, there are two kinds one is called ACH and that stands for automated clearinghouse, it's a centralized computer system that sits in connection to all official banks and they will make sure that the money move from one bank to the next is routed through correctly.

<img width="1919" height="890" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2775063b-c025-4dbe-9d2b-7941d8cfd59b" />

- It's a fully automated system, doesn't incur any specific cost typically, although sometimes banks decide to charge for these things, but it's a two to three business day process and what the system does it ensures that the money gets routed in the correct way. The other option is a wire transfer which happens the same-day, has some costs to it and it's pretty automated, but not fully automated. So those are typically for some more immediate reasons that you have to route that payment using a wire transfer.

## Commercial Credit Cards

<img width="1919" height="955" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/931430b8-5de3-49db-a663-adf4ce110f6e" />

- Another category of payments are commercial credit cards. These are similar to the credit cards that would be sitting in people's wallets and they function pretty much the same way. Businesses would receive business specific statements and that allow them to track their expenses a little bit better. But in general, the whole setup works just like in the consumer business. Initially most companies would take out credit cards to give to their employees, so they could travel and all of the expenses were neatly organized in that travel category. However, it also happened right around the Great Recession that traveled declined as it usually does in a recession and credit card companies started looking at alternative uses for credit cards. They're trying to increase the usage for different purposes other than travel.

<img width="1919" height="943" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7d19816-51fc-4c82-a5cf-1d787281371f" />

- So a lot of procurement departments have started implementing strategies around using credit cards because it hold some advantages. So if you look at the process, you are buying goods from a supplier and you give them a credit card number, which they can run right away and their bank will receive the funds fairly quickly within a couple days. It doesn't take any longer than an ACH transaction. Now what happens on the back-end is that there are three entities involved. One is the merchant acquire and that is the bank that the seller uses. Then there's a processor in between and that's the credit card network. Then there's the card issuer, where the buyer has obtained their card from.
- Those three entities have to work together to make that payment possible. The process is typically referred to as interchain. Ultimately a credit card company such as Visa, or MasterCard, or American Express is really a data company. They move information from one point to the next in a secure way and they believe in it so much that they actually guarantee the payments. So any fraud and risk costs are typically put on one of these three entities involved in the process. So it's it's typically a low-risk transaction. It's like the money can move into a completely different account.
- However, the risk typically has to do with employees at the buying organization having a way to purchase items without any checks and balances. Because as soon as a card number is given out to a seller and they charged it, that money is moved. So it's typically a lot harder to recover. But the general idea is that a credit card transaction costs somewhere between two and half and four percent of the money that's moved. Typically the seller receives less of that, the amount a charge due to those fees. Now when you think about the buyer's perspective in a lot of ways, they're saving a lot of documentation and transactional costs by not issuing a purchase order, and they pay as soon as they buy items that reduces a lot of work that the buyer has to do. Well, the money saved is significantly more than the two and half to four percent that is paid on a credit card transaction.
- The other advantage is that typically you have a good chunk of time that it takes to pay that bill. So you do have a DPO extension advantage by using a credit card. So those are the two main reasons why procurement departments are increasingly looking at credit cards. The last one is there are typically are rewards or rebates offered to the buyer for using a credit card. So similar to consumer credit cards, where there are points or things like that. A company can receive cash back as part of using a credit card as well. These rebates, if you purchase a lot, can be up into millions of dollars that companies can receive just for using credit cards.
- So in general, credit cards are making their way into procurement transactions. It's still a very small, small category for a lot of procurement people, but it's one that is growing at a pretty significant rate. There are also new types of cards that companies can use. One is the ghost card, which is you don't get a plastic card, but it has specific restrictions on it. So the idea is similar having a travel card, where it can only be used at hotels, and restaurants, and airlines. The ghost card can be customized to be only used on certain vendors or maybe just a specific organization. You can initiate additional controls that prevent abuse by employees or misuse, not even abuse.

<img width="1919" height="950" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceb5603b-5675-4f19-8767-8896d4ea02cb" />

- A virtual card that's an even more secure way of initiating and payment and account numbers are generated for a specific transaction. So they're used once in a very specifically designed situation, and then it doesn't exist anymore. So if you're looking at situations where you're not sure that the card number might not be stolen. If you use a virtual card, it will only work that one time and then it ceases to exist. So it's much more secure. Those two inventions have typically alleviated the concern of procurement managers for misuse of the cards.

## Supply Chain Finance

- Now let's talk about supply chain finance, and this describes a process in which buyers and sellers can move money from one to the next in a way that both sides actually get an advantage. I'll explain how in a second. So don't worry about the complication of this chart, I'll break it all down to specific pieces. So we have a supplier, they send goods to a buyer accompanied by an invoice and that invoice gets submitted to a supply chain finance provider as soon as it's approved. Typically the buyer would approve an invoice as soon as they know that all of the goods that were supposed to be invoiced are received properly and so on. So as soon as the goods are received, everything's okay, the buyer approves the invoice. The provider system will then send a notice to the supplier saying that, "You can receive payment for this invoice."

<img width="1919" height="934" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62db602d-2e4a-4a57-815b-9f86f3b0ddff" />

- Now, before all of that happened, the buyer and the supplier agreed on a 90 day payment term, and the supplier has the option of receiving payment in as little as 10 days if they agree to the supply chain finance agreement. Or they can wait the entire 90 days and get paid when the agreement states they should get paid. Now, if they want early payment, obviously, they have to take a discount on the amount of the invoice, and I'll get back to the point of how much is that discount. But in order for the provider to enable early payment, they have to have financing available that is used to bridge the gap between the buyer paying exactly on day 90 of that invoice and the supplier receiving early payment. So somebody has to come up for the money in the meantime to bridge these 80 or so days that it could take between the supplier wanting their money and the buyer finally paying the bill in full. That money comes from banks or other types of funders. Sometimes insurance companies are involved in this and they are financing these receivables.
- Now when they look at making these loans available, they look at the credit risk of the buyer and that's the big innovation in this. So in the past, a supplier who had an approved invoice could go to a bank and receive early payment but that had to do with their own credit rating, and what if for some reason a buyer that we don't know decides not to pay? So the risk to the bank then was significantly higher. Now we have an approved invoice from a known buyer, we can assess that credit risk a lot better. Typically, interest rates in this type of setup are somewhere between 1.5-2 percent over a risk-free rate which we typically use libor. So in effect, libor used to be almost zero. This could be a 2, 2.5 percent annual interest rate to receive early payment on these invoices.
- So on an 80 day transaction, that would be less than half of a percent for a supplier to receive early payment. So it's a very low cost transaction for the supplier. If they waited and they got financing somewhere else, they would pay a significantly higher interest rate, sometimes three, four times as much. So for them it's a very cheap way to get access to early capital and maybe in up past the payment term was 60 days and by getting payment as earliest day 10, they accelerate their day sales outstanding by 50 days. So that can be a significant benefit to their day sales outstanding, and then the buyer can move from 60 day payment terms to 90-day payment terms. So their DPO are going to increase as well. So this is how the system works and it has provided a lot of benefits to both sides.

<img width="1919" height="927" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3b35ce9-55c0-40b2-8cdf-cf21b21aa4e0" />

- Actually even the banks are able to participate in lending to companies that they previously weren't able to lend before. So it's an interesting arrangement and one that is used by a good number of large companies and we see more and more companies looking at these types of setup so that they can alleviate the pressure on their payables. In other words, increase the amount of cash that they hold internally but also not by taking that cash from their suppliers but allowing their suppliers to get paid quicker than they would have before, and that's where the win-wins comes from. So main features, that supplier has an early payment option. The buyer can choose to extend payment terms without necessarily negatively affecting the supplier and we also have additional capital in the supply chain.

## Supplier Pay Announcement

https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/11/president-obama-announces-new-partnership-private-sector-strengthen-amer

President Obama Announces New Partnership with the Private Sector  to Strengthen America’s Small Businesses; Renews the Federal  Government’s QuickPay Initiative
                                                  

As a part of his Year of  Action, the President is using the power of his pen and phone wherever  he can on behalf of the American people to create jobs and help  hard-working Americans get ahead. Today, the President will announce the  creation of SupplierPay, a new partnership with the private sector to  strengthen small businesses by increasing their working capital, so they  can grow their businesses and hire more workers. 

To launch SupplierPay, the President is bringing together 26 companies – both large and small – that have committed to the 
initiative
.   For the larger companies, joining SupplierPay demonstrates a  recognition that a healthy supply chain is good for business.  For the  small business suppliers, benefiting from SupplierPay means having more  capital to invest in new opportunities, new equipment, and new hiring.

President Obama, Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett, National Economic  Council Director Jeff Zients, and Small Business Administrator Maria  Contreras-Sweet will host a meeting at the White House today with these  businesses and their suppliers to discuss what more can be done to  strengthen small businesses, building on the successes of the QuickPay  program.

SupplierPay builds on the success of the Federal Government’s  QuickPay initiative, which President Obama launched in 2011. QuickPay  requires federal agencies to expedite payments to small business  contractors with the goal of paying within 15 days.  As a result of  QuickPay, we have already seen well over $1 billion in cost savings for  small businesses since 2011, leading to greater investment and job  creation. SupplierPay is the private sector’s equivalent, where  companies have committed to pay small suppliers faster or help them get  access to lower cost capital.

Also today, the President is renewing QuickPay for federal small  business subcontractors, where the government pays its large contractors  faster and, in return, requires them to pay their small business  subcontractors faster. QuickPay for small business subcontractors, which  began in 2012, was only available temporarily for many small business  subcontractors.  Today’s announcement means faster payment for all small  business subcontractors and even more business opportunities, more  investment in small businesses, and more hiring.

The following companies have signed on to SupplierPay:

Apple

AT&T

Authentix

Cardinal Health

Coca-Cola

CVS  

Ericsson 

FedEx

Honda

IBM

Intuit   

Johnson & Johnson 

Kelly Services

Lockheed Martin

Milliken

Molina Healthcare

Nissan

PG&E

Philips

Rothschild North America

Rolls Royce

Salesforce 

Textura

Toyota 

Walgreens

Westinghouse Electric Company

Small business play a vital role in the American economy – employing  half of our country's workforce, creating nearly two out of every three  new American jobs, and often being the source of the next great American  innovation.  

Small businesses were disproportionately impacted by the Great  Recession, losing 40 percent more jobs than the rest of the private  sector combined. When the President took office small business credit  markets were effectively frozen. Today, trends are moving in the right  direction; according to a recent survey, small business confidence is  near the highest levels since the fall of 2007 and small businesses are  back to creating two of out of every three net new jobs.

Small business capital access has been an area of focus for this  Administration, starting with the Recovery Act in 2009, the Small  Business Jobs Act in 2010 and the JOBS Act in 2012. Collectively, this  legislation has been instrumental in driving improvement from the depths  of the recession. The Administration has achieved record SBA small  business lending volumes and recent Federal Reserve Small Business  surveys indicate improved access to financing. Yet, more can be done – too many small businesses still struggle to access the capital they need.

## Interest Rates

<img width="1919" height="938" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7a7a57b-d574-4bb6-9c3f-3c7a4639967f" />

- So one important feature that has to do with supply chain finance are interest rates. The interest rate in a supply chain finance program is typically made up of LIBOR, which stands for the London Inter-Bank Overnight Rate, which is a proxy for the interest rate that is currently charged, and most loans are set up the same way. There's some benchmark metric of interest rate, and then risk premiums are attached on top of that or added to it. So the total rate is made up of LIBOR plus a risk premium. As I mentioned before, the risk premium is dependent on the credit rating of the buyer, and a lot of these programs have started in large companies that are fairly highly rated. When we look at LIBOR, here is a chart of historical LIBOR rates and there're different ones. There's a one month, a three months, a six months, and 12 months and that's why you see these different lines, but they all work together.

<img width="1919" height="895" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af0e0c2e-e264-47f4-851e-9b128d185897" />

- We see that between 2009 and about 2015, LIBOR rates were at almost practically zero, and they've recently started increasing. But historically, they're still at a very, very low rate, some of the lowest rates we'd ever seen. In about 2008 and 2009 is when the supply chain finance programs became a lot more popular. Some people would argue that it has to do with these historically low interest rates and that's why we can say, ''Look, 80 day early payment only costs you less than half of a percent.'' Then the argument would go that, well, if interest rates were a lot higher, this wouldn't be very attractive. But as I mentioned before, the supplier has the alternative of not accepting early payment and just waiting until they get paid in full. By doing that, they rely more heavily on the financing that they are able to obtain themselves.

<img width="1919" height="910" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/610385ab-a193-4d4a-8c8e-7c0331be5f9d" />

- So typically, that financing is tied to LIBOR as well. So if LIBOR goes up, their own cost of borrowing goes up. If LIBOR goes down, their cost of borrowing goes down. But the buyer, if it has a comparative advantage in risk premium because they have higher credit worthiness, then that supply chain finance arrangement is going to lead to a lower interest rate than a supplier would be able to obtain otherwise. Here's a table of credit ratings. Typically, we see companies being rated at a certain level and the triple A's in capital letters and non-capital letters, and there's a whole alphabet of different ratings. But typically, the highest is triple A, the lowest is C or D.
- Your interest rate is going to be dependent on that credit rating specifically. So that's how you can determine what the risk premium on a company's loan is. If we assume that the buyer is typically one with a better credit rating than the supplier, then there is an advantage in terms of agreeing to a supply chain finance arrangement and then also obtaining a better interest rate than you would otherwise.

## Cost of Capital

<img width="1919" height="945" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52d06da4-edf5-4c0f-aea1-06ef206c052d" />

- The cost of capital. One of the key features of whether supply chain finance makes sense is that if you have a buyer with a low cost of capital and they can arrange for supply chain finance agreement, then a supplier with a higher cost of capital is going to benefit from that. So the way I look at this is if we have a supplier and let's say a supply chain, and there are two tiers of suppliers, we are trying to inject liquidity at the intersection between a supplier and the manufacturer, and maybe that supplier can then have a similar arrangement for their Tier 2 supplier. The effect of that is that we get additional cash into all three of these companies that are described in the supply chain. That's the key thing about using supply chain finance. But if everybody was using this, there would be additional liquidity injected into the supply chains because manufacturers, even though they don't take out any additional loans, manufacturers are able to save their cash because they pay their bills later. So in other words, cash gets created by decreasing accounts payable.

<img width="1919" height="981" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f851b7b-6573-4e1d-acef-776a51c5c942" />

- Then the Tier 1 supplier is going to receive additional cash from both sides, one by getting earlier payment, and the other one by conserving their cash by paying their own bill slower. So two components of their cash conversion cycle are going to work positively. So DPO is going up and DSO is going down for the Tier 1 supplier. Then for the Tier 2 supplier, they get a benefit by receiving early payment. We don't know what they do with their own suppliers then. But if every company in the supply chain is using supply chain finance, or to a certain extent you could do similar things with corporate credit cards, then we have an injection of cash into the supply chain. Now it doesn't mean that they necessarily carry more cash, but they might be able to reduce some of their liabilities or have to issue fewer bonds.
- In an environment, as what we've seen in the last couple of years where smaller and medium sized businesses have a significantly more difficult time of accessing liquidity, this is one of the ways companies are able to raise their liquidity. So in other words, they can't go out and get loans, but they can participate in these types of programs and get additional cash this way. So I know when you look at the literature, there are positive and negative views on these types of arrangement. But in general, we can say that additional liquidity can be created through these types of setups. It's also a way to get additional liquidity. Even if there was an alternative, this is a much cheaper way of doing it.

## SCF Decisions

- Now let's talk about some supply chain finance decisions. And we go back to this chart. One is the buyer has to, obviously for them to have any benefit in this, they're going to have to decide to extend their official payment terms. And that is sometimes a controversial decision because it just means that you're not going to pay your suppliers as fast as you did in the past. And you don't necessarily know how suppliers will react to that. The other one on the supplier side is do they agree wholesale to this arrangement, or do they decide to wait? And if they wait, what are the repercussions of that?

<img width="1919" height="943" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb717dd1-91d8-4c79-8f92-35dcfdec2479" />

- It's interesting that in my experience, what a lot of people expected when they implemented these types of programs was that all of the small suppliers are jumping on this opportunity and they take the early payment, whereas larger companies are not. The interesting thing to me was that even larger companies participate in these types of programs, even if their own cost of borrowing, their own cost of capital is lower than what they get in this arrangement. So you might have the supplier being a gigantic company that's rated AAA and they will take this early payment arrangement, even though they could get capital cheaper somewhere else. But it also has to do with every company only gets a certain amount of capital that they can raise, that banks will lend them. So by participating in early payment, they conserve some of that ability of getting financing, so they don't need to take out that many loans. And if they are in a situation where they need additional loans, they can easily get them because they're not maxed out in terms of their overall borrowing. So from those two perspectives, there's one, an interest rate advantage that they can gain, and the other one would be a just diversification advantage.
- Now, some people will say, well you still have the supplier paying 0.5%, 1%, whatever it may be. Now in the past, at least in the United States, what we typically saw is suppliers going with a payment term that was called 2, 10 net 30. So that means a 2% discount for payment within 10 days and the full amount is due within 30 days. So in the past, companies were very comfortable giving a 2% discount for payment within 10 days, which this basically is. So when we think about this arrangement, you actually give less of a discount for the same end result. You get paid within about 10 days and you don't give a 2% discount. So up until interest rates are so high, if they ever get that high again, where an early pay discount would amount to basically a 2% discount on an invoice, I think we're within a fairly safe territory.
- Let's talk about the other side of the the chart. When it comes to who provides the funding, it's a group of banks that decided to lend in this arrangement. And typically, what they have is a higher interest rate than alternative options. And it's very short-term funding, because you pay an invoice which is a reasonably small amount for a small period, so typically less than the 90 days. And you can make 2 or 3% annualized interest if you participate in that with virtually no risk, because you know the buyer. Typically, it's a highly rated company and you get a fairly nice return on your investment.

## Payment Practices

- Now let's talk about payment practices. This goes to a study that we actually did here at Rutgers. We tried to develop an index of how satisfied suppliers are with how their customers are paying them, because one of the arguments was, if you're receiving timely payments and all of that from your customers, you're going to be a lot happy with how that relationship is going. So we came up with the seven practices. One is the length of payment terms, the history of on-time payments, invoice adjustments, visibility of approved invoices, payment dispute resolution, offering of alternative funding options, and then we also asked them about the overall satisfaction. So these seven practices were tracked for multiple companies, and based on responses that we would receive, we would put together a ranking of these companies in terms of supplier satisfaction. So we did this and it's some interesting results.

## Payment Practices Index

- So the payment practices index worked as follows, we had these measures that were put together to measure the vendor satisfaction with the payment and we looked specifically at retailers. One of the things that we had observed and something that we've talked about here is the longer payment terms and it was interesting to see how vendors or suppliers would react to those and our goal was to rank the top 50 retailers by size in the United States. We ask them these seven questions and we had 630 respondents. So the rankings were then created afterwards and they look as follows, and some of these retailers you might know, others you might not necessarily know, some of them were regional players. However, what was very interesting was in addition to the actual responses, it seems that different retailers are treating their suppliers in slightly different ways. So what I mean by that, things that are going to make that level of satisfaction go down would be things other than the specific length of the payment terms. So for example, invoice adjustments were a cause of dissatisfaction or having companies call in to fix certain things regarding to payment or just making the process overall more difficult.

<img width="1919" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/610ced3c-0cec-4e5b-904f-9b186e9c704b" />

- Sometimes that was the biggest cause of dissatisfaction in addition to longer payment terms. Payment terms also seemed, even within the retail industry, if we look at the subclassification of these retailers, some are grocery stores, some are for example Costco is a large quantity retailer, you can't buy this things in small quantities. Some are special stores like Sherwin-Williams, they sell to Spain and we can see that within these different categories, the payment term length kind of is very consistent, but they can vary across these categories. So Dollar Tree, for example, is known for rather fast payment terms because they're in that specific category of dollar type low-cost retailers and they pay their suppliers very quickly, versus other types of category that pay a lot slower.

## Payment Practices Satisfaction

- So when we look at the different practices and the satisfaction with those practices, I'll go through each one of these in a little bit of detail. So the length of payment terms. Ultimately, what we see is in the past, for a lot of companies the payment term was 30 days and it moved towards 60, 90, and in some cases, we see payment terms reaching a 120 days. As we saw on the Amazon example for example, it's keeps moving up fairly consistently and that seems to be the way business is being done. I'm not sure when we're going to see an end to these payment term extensions but right now it's a slow increase and a slow movement. On-time payments, well, on-time payments have to do with whatever payment term was negotiated and then whether the buyer actually adheres to them. In many cases, the seller doesn't necessarily have that much recourse, especially if they are small seller selling to a large buyer, the recourse is often fairly limited.

<img width="1919" height="943" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2640ab8f-f331-4b1a-b270-402b09888286" />

- So their buyer doesn't want to pay their bills on time. There's not that much they can do other than stop doing business with them and that is typically a large portion of their revenue. So it's a dangerous thing to do probably. So you have to be very careful with this. You'd think that the recourse can be fairly significant, but oftentimes not necessarily. Invoice adjustments, there are different things and that's where it became very interesting hearing from these vendors. For example, if a customer refuses to pay the full invoice, they hold a reserve because they think something is going to go poorly in the future, so they hold back some money from an invoice or a charge or otherwise known as a penalty for insufficient performance, may be the shipment was late or there are fewer items or something wasn't done to the specification of the buyer, it can result in charge and typically it's a charge back on a future invoice.

<img width="1919" height="886" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b294940e-9646-4e52-b493-3b06cb411060" />

- So as you observe something wasn't done right and then on a future invoice, they charge you back for it. So they withhold the full amount of payment due to things that were done in the past. Holds are typically delays of invoices due to certain inconsistency, maybe the invoice wasn't submitted correctly. So invoice adjustments are huge source of dissatisfaction for a lot of vendors. The other category we looked at was visibility of approved invoices. Can you visually see what is happening to your invoices with a certain vendor? For example, Walmart, which is still the largest retailer in the US, has a system called Retail Link, where they're able to provide their vendors a portal into what's going on with their items at Walmart, not just inventory levels, but also what happens to those invoices that they submitted, so you see whether it's been paid or unpaid or what happen there.

<img width="1919" height="938" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ed86ed2-b455-4d5f-9e35-e1d84ced5591" />

- Payment dispute resolution, what happens? What process is in place if there's a dispute about an invoice? Usually, there's a phone number that the vendor has to call and they have to talk to certain people but it's making that process easier will ease a lot of concerns because disputes do happen occasionally. Alternative funding option, how easy is it for these vendors to have access to be paid, let's say via commercial credit card receive faster payment or supply chain finance or dynamic discounting which is also an option.

## Trends and Seasonality

- Now, let's look at a little bit more forecasting and we're going to do something a little bit different from the previous methods which were just methods to use when demand is more or less stationary or fairly flat. We're going to look at trends and seasonality because many cases we have hopefully positive trends which means demand grows. And in many cases we also have seasonal buying patterns of product. So we need to be able to incorporate trends and seasonality into our forecast. So trends are defined as consistent growth in demand or consistent decline. Hopefully not decline, but there's significant patterns that occur period after period. And seasonality is defined as something that's recurring it goes up.

<img width="1919" height="965" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87e15516-d7f9-4d2a-a968-c300ac54b686" />

- It goes down and comes back up the that could be a seasonality. It's not the four seasons of the year, but it's just defined as patterns that are reoccurring. So this is what trended data would look like. So it doesn't mean that every period is greater than the period before but in general, so the demand could go down for a couple periods. But in general there is a positive trend so the line slopes upwards. As opposed to level demand which stays around that fixed range of around a hundred plus minus goes up and goes down but it's around a hundred. So the blue line is where you can use all of the methods that we just discussed and however, if your demand looks more like the trended line the red line, then you need to do something first.

<img width="1919" height="927" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e045281a-735c-45c4-b6f6-fa0a30f21c34" />

<img width="1919" height="934" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/160f1c6d-a984-45c9-bf2c-9e3928095d6b" />

- In order to use your forecasting methods. Now seasonal data would look more like this. So it's going up but it's coming back down and there's some where an average but it's definitely a lot more pronounced and a lot more regular than what we see and just random variations of level demand. So if you have a pattern like that and you may not, then you need to take into account that seasonality. If there's no reoccurring pattern, then so be it but that's a big distinction between between seasonal data. It could have a situation however where your demand is seasonal and trended at the same time. So you have these ups and downs, but you also have a slight overall increase to take it into account.

## Estimating Trends

- Now let's look at how to estimate trends. The objective is you're trying to determine on average how much does demand increase per period. So and another way of looking at it, graphically, you're trying to find a slope. There's a very easy way to do it. If you graph, if you have a graph in your spreadsheet, then typically there's an option to add a trend line. That trend line, often you can say give me the regression equation. So by setting that trend line, you can get a regression equation.

<img width="1918" height="932" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c87e53cb-fb81-4cc4-a4eb-695ed5eb2429" />

- Within that regression equation, you have the slope of that line. Now the other way would be to use the regression function if you know how to do that but for our purposes, all you need to do is add that trend line and find that regression equation, which is, at least to me, the quickest way of doing it is to use the trend line and that's all you need. That gives you the slope. Now once you have the slope, then you can add that to each forecast and that's going to give you that increase in demand. Now, the only thing you have to be careful about is, as you move forward, you might want to recalculate the slope because that slope might change over time. Just by doing it once, you may be missing out. So you just want to be careful with that.

<img width="1915" height="939" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5c62ce7-6c49-45d4-be2a-4169e952898b" />

- So I did it here in this example. I had that same red trend line and I clicked into the graph, I said I wanted to add a trend line. There was a checkbox that said, "Do you want the regression equation?" That's what the result was. So the way to read this is you look at, say, you've y, y is basically your answer. The trend line is made up by the intercept, that's 91 and the slope, and the slope is 5.267. So depending on the month, we multiply the month or the period by 5.267.
- So that also means that each period, our average growth in demand is 5.26, so more than five. Now, you could simplify that and say, I'll add five to each of my forecast. But that's ultimately what do you do or you could be very precise and add 5.267 to each forecast and it would predict that increase in demand. So that would be hard to add a trend component to your forecast. Now, the other part would also be you could divide past demand by that slope and then that would make the line go flat again. Then you could go back and use the other methods, maybe a moving average or an exponential smoothing to determine past demand. Then as you predict demand, you add in that 5.267 as average period growth.

## Estimating Seasonality

<img width="1919" height="943" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0d8d058-a8f4-4c42-8c2b-43cafb20b18f" />

- Now, how do we estimate seasonality? That's a little bit trickier than estimating trend, but it's still fairly straightforward. So when we are trying to figure out, what is the length or what is that seasonality in the first place? I made some notes on this graph. So hopefully, it's fairly straightforward to follow along. So we have 24 months of data and we can also see that every four months and if you don't see it, then try to look at it and just count the periods. So we have the first two periods are around 100, then it goes up and comes back down to around 100, goes back up and it comes back down.
- So every fourth we seem to restart the same pattern. So our season as we define it in this example is four periods long. So now, when we are season as four periods long in this whole Data Stream, we have 24 months. So we get with six occurrences of the same pattern to around 100 and then it shoots up to 130, 140, and then it comes back down to around 100 and so on and there's up and down. So this happens six times in Artemis S1, S2, S3, 4, 5 and 6 and then so those are the seasons. Then period one, period two, period three, period four are within each season. So when we're trying to create a forecast, we need to keep those things in mind.
- Because what we're trying to do is we're trying to determine what from our baseline, what is either the increase or the decrease in demand as we move through a season. That's what we're trying to accomplish. So we know there are four periods in each season, can average demand over all of those four periods. So that would be the first thing and then we can estimate this P1 by taking the demand in that first period and dividing it by that seasonal average. For P2, we take demand in the second period divided by the average, P3 with the demand in the third period and so forth. Then what you have is a percentage increase from the average and then that will let us either, well, the first thing that we would do with this would be to take this seasonal index and then multiply your demand, your actual demand by the seasonal factor. So three if four in each season and you spread those out over your entire data stream and by taking out that seasonality, what would happen is that your demand is removed of the seasonality, so you've no more seasonality left and the only variations would be noise.

<img width="1919" height="962" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/732addd3-410b-4940-8c45-043c98b50658" />

- So now you could go back, use your moving average or exponential smoothing or whatever you deem as appropriate and you don't have these big increases. Now once you did that and you create that forecast, then you need to go back to your seasonal index and then build that seasonality back into it. So there's one more step afterwards, but that's how you would use the methods we had that which were designed for stationary demand and apply it to non-stationary demand, which is what often you face. So just to reiterate, you find the seasonality you de-seasonalized, you use your stationary forecasts, your moving average or exponential smoothing and then you re-seasonalize and then your forecast will take into account those patterns that you had. 

<img width="1919" height="946" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f365b671-e86f-4ab5-91e3-f30b5f041584" />

## Combining Trends & Seasonality

<img width="1919" height="948" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f9bccff-bd6b-4a07-956a-00add0c209ad" />

- All right. Now, what would you do if you had seasonal and trended data? Where you combine trends and seasonality. So how do you do that? You have to go through a couple of steps. Step number 1 is, you remove the trend. So you find the slope of your trend line and basically remove all of that trend as you go back in time.
- Then you look at your seasonality, and you find that seasonality and deseasonalize your forecast. Then you apply your forecast, then you go back and try the seasonality by the trend, and then what you come up with as your forecast is going to follow that exact seasonal and trended pattern. So it's a couple of steps and it's a lot more than what we did with stationary forecast, but those workarounds are unfortunately necessary to predict seasonal and trended data. Now, just looking forward, there would be methods that can do all of this all at once. It's not like you take away any of these steps, it still is fairly complex, but if you get more into forecasting there are even more advanced methods. But for the purposes of this course we'll stick with this. So how would it be looking?
- Well, so you take your seasonal and trended forecast you turn it into a just seasonal forecast, and then it's flat. That's what you apply the methods that we learned previously. Then you dot all and reverse and that's how you get your final result.

<img width="1919" height="928" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/145f7a7f-1e86-4a32-80cc-f2d9ed184ed1" />
