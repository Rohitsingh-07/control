## Impact of SCM on Income Statement

- So let's wrap up this course with the impact of supply chain management on the financial statements in general and let's start with the income statement. And what I'll do is I'll talk about different categories on the income statement and then talk about specific supply chain activities that can improve that category. So we'll start with sales and revenue, then go to cost of good sold, and then go to overhead costs. And the idea is that there are specific activities that supply chain management can contribute to the income statement. And very often the idea is that supply chain management is just a cost center. So these costs are not always the only contribution that supply chain has, there are revenue implications as well for example. And those are things that are not necessarily intuitive to most people.
- So that's why I want to go through the income statement at least the main categories and talk about where supply chain management activities can have a positive benefit.

## Sales/Revenue

- Let's start with sales and revenue. The impact of supply chain management on sales is that you are creating something that is of value to the customer. That consistency of delivery, that consistency of the quality of the product, the way products are moved, the availability that you offer is something that is a value. If you're doing better at than your competitors, that is going to differentiate you. Now it's not something as flashy as let's say a TV advertisement, but it is something real that is of value to the customers. The second category is the product and service mix that you can offer to customers. A better supply chain is going to be able to customize products and service offerings to specific customers, so you give every customer exactly the type of product and service that they're looking for and that holds some pretty significant value.
- By not stocking out, by not having too little inventory in the wrong places, you're going to avoid lost sales, that's a real thing. Few or lost sales is going to mean higher revenue. By keeping the inventory offerings in your supply chain fresh, you're not going to have to mark things down or have items returned because the products are old or out of date. So those are I would say the four main ways supply chain management can impact sales and revenue in a company.

## Cost of Goods Sold

- Let's talk about the next category, which is cost of goods sold. This is where traditionally a lot of supply chain activities have been focused on, and there are several areas where one would be in sourcing. Obviously, sourcing our procurement is directly responsible for the cost of materials, and it's not just direct materials, but also indirect materials, services. Everything that goes through sourcing will have a direct impact on how much money is spent on producing items. So that's a fairly important task, and it's a big source of the cost incurred for a company. Also, if a supply chain is able to develop a virtual vertical integration and basically use the suppliers as an extension of their own organization, that's going to have a positive impact on costs as well. Another big category is manufacturing.
- So by improving manufacturing processes, you'll be able to make products cheaper. By improving productivity, you can make more products in the same amount of time, and by improving production, well, you'll have fewer returns and fewer rejected items, and all of those things cost money. So by working better, you are having a direct impact on these costs.

## Impact of SCM on Balance Sheet

- Now let's talk about the impact of Supply Chain Management on the balance sheet. So we're going to go through cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, inventories and plant, property and equipment on the asset side, and then mainly focus on accounts payables on the liability side. So when we think about what the balance sheet represented, it represents what kind of stuff do we have in the company and who's paying, who owns it. Most of the assets that we can touch through Supply Chain Management are on the short term asset side, increase in cash, Decreasing accounts receivable which also increases cash, decreasing inventory and then decreasing long-term assets, plants, property and equipment. What we're trying to do is shrink the balance sheet in such a way that it looks like the company generates a high amount of profit with fewer assets. In terms of an investor, that is going to look a lot more efficient than a company that produces a small net income with lots of assets and that's often how they look at efficiency. Can you produce a lot of profit with very little input because if I'm thinking of investing in the company, then a small increase in assets, it's going to result in a large increase in profit. So, that is an important factor to consider for an investor.

## Short Term Assets

- Let's talk about short-term assets. Cash and cash equivalents are the most liquid form of assets that we have, because it doesn't get any more liquid than cash. So if you're using the supply chain to create capital, then it's going to reduce the need to generate cash through other means. So you don't have to necessarily go out and get loans or raise equity or do anything else if that cash is generated through the supply chain. So it's a very important aspect of the supply chain to generate cash. Accounts receivable, obviously, are something you want to reduce because, all things being equal, if you're able to reduce accounts receivable, that means you're not waiting as long on the customer to pay their bills to you and you get more cash. So it's usually like a scale.
- So the less accounts receivable you have, the more cash you have, because your customers already paid their bills. So better supply chain management leads your customer to pay you faster. Inventory. There are a lot of things we can do in terms of inventory. One has to do with forecasting and demand planning, because then we're able to reduce safety stock and we have less inventory around. If we have better procurement, we'll be able to reduce our raw materials inventory. If we have better manufacturing, we'll be able to reduce our work-in-process inventory.
- Finally, if we have better logistics, we can reduce our finished goods inventory, and if we have the right mix of inventory, then it's not as likely to go obsolete. So there's various ways in which we can impact inventory, which directly goes on the balance sheet.

## Long Term Assets & Liabilities

- Now, let's talk about long-term assets and liabilities, so plant, property, and equipment. A lot of the PP&E is tied up in supply chain assets. So if you have plants around, optimizing the capacity planning or the equipment utilization is going to make the plants that you have more efficiently. So either you can have fewer plants available and accomplish the same output, or produce more items with the same number of plants, either of which is a good thing to do. On the warehouse side, if you are better at utilizing what you have and rationalizing what you have, that is going to reduce the number of assets available as well. Sometimes, companies choose to reduce their assets through outsourcing because they find it as a better solution than doing everything in-house, and sometimes just managing suppliers is easier than managing your own plant, so it has double benefits. In terms of liabilities, it's about payment terms and if you can hold onto cash longer.
- So by increasing your accounts payable, you are going to increase your cash because rather than spend it quickly, you spend it more slowly, and that means you have more cash available. Especially, supply chain finance techniques are going to improve accounts receivables and inventory, while keeping your cash as long as possible, so it's that win-win that we talked about.

## Impact of SCM on Financials

- Let's talk about the impact of supply chain management on the financials in general. So we started off this whole course by asking what is the contribution of supply chain management on the financial performance of a company? How do we measure measure the financial performance? It's a profit and loss statement, it's a balance sheet, and is the cash flow statement. Your job as a supply chain manager, supply chain executive is going to provide specific strategies techniques and execute in such a way that you impact these three statements. If you're not able to do that, that means you're not necessarily effective. Well, it's one thing to be able to do it, however, the other one is to communicate.
- So you first of all you need to know about these linkages in these connections to be able to communicate them and actually work on them. So that's one of the main reasons for the focus on the financial flow in the supply chain. Most companies are going to have a reward system for their supply chain people and here's one example, and it doesn't mean that every company is going to have exactly this model. But this is a fairly well-balanced model. It relies on two main categories, one is customer satisfaction, and the other one is financial performance. So the goal is to satisfy your customers while being financially prudent. I mean, it's very easy to woo your customers if you spend unlimited amounts of money, but you're not going to necessarily have any profit left over by doing that.
- So within customer satisfaction, we look at predictability, i.e. making promises and keeping them and responsiveness. How quick and how flexible is your supply chain? And then on the financial performance, we want to impact the profit and loss statement or the income statement by delivering a world-class cost structure. And we want to impact the balance sheet and cash flow statement by moving assets quickly. So those are the four main categories which I'll discuss next.

###########################################################################################################
###########################################################################################################
###########################################################################################################

## Rewards System: Customer Satisfaction

- Let's first talk about the customer satisfaction side of the reward system. Predictability, what does it mean? It means that you have on-time delivery of the firm and you make your suppliers have on-time delivery as well, because the supply chain really go both ways and you have to hold both yourself and your suppliers responsible for meeting goals that were set. Because ultimately, everything is connected and it trickles down to the customer. Next is the service level. You have to have an appropriate service level, i.e, a high enough fill rate so that you don't stock out of inventory. You accomplish all of that by having an accurate forecast and an accurate inventory visibility in your company.
- If you don't have both a good forecast and visibility in your inventory, you're not going to accomplish your service level or your on-time delivery rate. So it really starts with the forecast and the inventory. Then on the responsiveness side, we're looking at lead time and the shorter the lead time, the better it usually is. Customers want a short lead time or short as possible lead time. Then flexibility, can you yourself as a company be flexible? Also make sure that flexibility translates into your suppliers, demand it from your suppliers. Because the more flexibility you have, the more you can also make up for any deficiencies you had in terms of your predictability.
- They work hand in hand and you need to focus on both, you can't just say, "Oh, I don't care about predictability because I have flexibility." It doesn't necessarily work quite as well, or it comes at a much higher cost. Then can you offer your customer multiple seamless delivery options that they can choose from for their specific situation or at different points in time. Those are key metrics that your customers will respond to. Those are probably the most important metrics, both on the predictable and the responsiveness side that your customers are going to care about and reward in terms of future purchases.

## Rewards System: Financial Performance

- Now let's talk about financial performance in the reward system. So obviously the profit and loss statement, some companies like to use the gross margin return on investment, which is basically a metric that looks at how much inventory you hold and what the average gross margin of that inventory is. That's a popular metric, especially for retailers, but it tracks very closely. Do you stock the right inventory? Next one is total supply chain cost as a percentage of revenue. The better your supply chain, the more efficient your supply chain is, the lower that percentage. And then finally your year-to-year contribution to profits.
- So as companies are looking to increase their profit year over year, how much of that profit increase was contributed by the supply chain? All three of these are fairly important metrics. And then on the balance sheet side, can you move the cash conversion cycle forward? So can you affect DSO, DIO, and DPO? Then what are you net asset turns? If you're able to have your assets, then that also means you turn the assets over a lot quicker, especially inventory. And then finally, customer days of supply.
- Are you able to keep your customers supplied at the level that they're expecting? So by keeping inventory at the supplier you don't have to necessarily keep it on your own balance sheet. So are you good at moving inventory downstream to your suppliers? And that's going to affect your own balance sheet. So these are, in more detail, the metrics that a lot of companies would care about. And having a efficient supply chain, or an excellent supply chain, is going to speak to those metrics. So you can hit those metrics better if your supply chain is better. And ultimately that's a very objective way of tracking the performance of your supply chain, if you can contribute in these ways.

## "NOT JUST" a Cost Center

- So as I want to just wrap up with this one thought that in the early years of supply chain management, a lot of people dismissed the importance of the field as well supply chain is just a cost center. So I want to finish on this thought that now supply chain is not just a cost center. When you think about this following statement, marketing generates sales, supply chain fulfills them, true or false? Well, if you have a good supply chain, that supply chain can generate sales in enough itself, even though marketing is responsible for sale. Imagine you have a store that you go to and they are a great store, they promote their items, they get you in there, and then you go in there, and the item is not available. It was the greatest marketing possible, but execution in the supply chain wasn't very good because the item wasn't available. Are you likely to go back there if over and over they get you in and they don't have the product? Maybe not.
- But if on the other hand you have a store where you know that if you look for a certain item, it's always going to be there that, is in and off itself going to be a driver for future business. So I don't think that it's only marketing's job to get you to a customer into the door. So repeat customers can come from excellent experiences, because we evaluate the experience and we decide whether we're going to go back there. It's typically those bad experiences that don't necessarily make us go back somewhere. So a lot of things that go wrong will then keep our customers away from us in the future. So and ultimately, I will admit that supply chain management is the thing that if we screw up, then is going to have an impact on customer experiences and they might not come back. So we have to almost always be perfect in terms of our execution.
- That's why supply chain excellence is really about being very consistent and providing the same experience in terms of products and services to the customer, so they have a reason to come back.
