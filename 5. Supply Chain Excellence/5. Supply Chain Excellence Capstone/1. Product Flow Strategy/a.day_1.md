- Now let's talk about product flow strategy, and we'll start our journey through the strategy by talking about planning. And planning is there always a number of different types of planning approaches. I'll show you one which I particularly like, you may find companies use different variations of this or other ones all together. But this is the one I personally like, it's sort of a five-step approach. It starts with focus. You want to understand exactly what you're trying to accomplish, then you analyze, then you plan, and execute, and then you re fine. And if necessary use kind of go back around if you need to really redefine focus and so on.
- Most companies have some kind of an approach to how they do things. What is important is that even when you think about the smaller group, if you have a an approach that with several steps, for example, and you follow it through. It's going to push you along to provide you with the right kind of answer. If you take it slowly and carefully, it's going to also let everybody on the team know here's the step that were at, here's what's coming next, and it's going to maintain everybody on the same line. So it's always a good idea to have some kind of a cycle that's going to lead you to get the outcome that you're looking for ultimately.

## Vertical Integration in the Supply Chain: Is it on the Rise?

Should Your Supply Chain Join the Vertical Integration Revival?
Ever  since the early 1970s supply chain organisations have taken on  increasingly distributed structures, a shift from a long-standing  tradition of vertical integration.

## Product Flow Options

- All right. Now, let's think about product flow options. When you think about the whole spectrum of what a supply chain could look like, one of the extremes would be vertical integration. Vertical integration means that the company is the whole supply chain start to finish. Or you have companies that just focus on their core competencies, and you orchestrate the supply chain, but you don't necessarily perform all of the different tasks. Traditionally, if you think back to the origins of, for example, the Ford Motor Company, the Model T, which was one of the all-time best-selling cars ever, was built entirely by Ford. So you had rubber, you had wood and yet iron-ore, were the three main ingredients, and all of the little components that the car was being built out of were done internally in the Ford Motor Company.
- Then at the other end, you actually have the finished car come out. On the other hand, you have also a very successful company today, which is Apple, which does not manufacturer a single one of their products. But they have very tight control over their entire supply chain, and they pick partners that will do certain tasks for them. They really just are like a conductor of an orchestra. They give everyone the direction in which they need to move, and they very carefully monitor what everybody does. The conductor of an orchestra does not play a single instrument him or herself. So if you are in the vertical integration category, you have to learn how to d o everything really, really well.
- Otherwise, the total is going to be not very good. You're not going to be very competitive. On the other hand, if you focus just on core competency, you have to get better at the things you're already doing well. Which is also not necessarily very easy because, if you're already pretty good at them, it's not as easy to get better at them. So that's the spectrum of things. Within that spectrum, every company has to figure out how much vertical integration we have, how much do we focus on core competency, and you'll be somewhere in the middle. You can't completely say, "I just orchestrate and everybody else does parts for me."
- Probably, in today's world, you can't just focus on vertical integration altogether. Neither of the extremes is very feasible. You'll have to find your niche of doing some parts yourself, and doing some parts by managing others, and find exactly the right way in between. How do you pick? Well, on the vertical integration side, we have capabilities and resources in play that enable you to be vertically integrated, at least in part of your supply chain. That's a question that is not that easy to answer. On the core competency side, we have providers that are very good at it.
- Can you achieve efficiency by letting others do certain parts? Since you're relying on third party, can you be competitive? Do you have enough unique things that you do internally to stand out compared to your competitors? Because if anybody could just copy you, then it'd be very easy to do things as good, if not, better than you.
