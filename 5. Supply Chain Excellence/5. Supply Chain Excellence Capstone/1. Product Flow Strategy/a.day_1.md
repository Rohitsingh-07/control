## Types of Planning

<img width="1919" height="952" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ac92280-bee3-4c1f-b557-eec74b4bd887" />

- Now let's talk about product flow strategy, and we'll start our journey through the strategy by talking about planning. And planning is there always a number of different types of planning approaches. I'll show you one which I particularly like, you may find companies use different variations of this or other ones all together. But this is the one I personally like, it's sort of a five-step approach. It starts with focus. You want to understand exactly what you're trying to accomplish, then you analyze, then you plan, and execute, and then you re fine. And if necessary use kind of go back around if you need to really redefine focus and so on.
- Most companies have some kind of an approach to how they do things. What is important is that even when you think about the smaller group, if you have a an approach that with several steps, for example, and you follow it through. It's going to push you along to provide you with the right kind of answer. If you take it slowly and carefully, it's going to also let everybody on the team know here's the step that were at, here's what's coming next, and it's going to maintain everybody on the same line. So it's always a good idea to have some kind of a cycle that's going to lead you to get the outcome that you're looking for ultimately.

## Vertical Integration in the Supply Chain: Is it on the Rise?

Should Your Supply Chain Join the Vertical Integration Revival?
Ever  since the early 1970s supply chain organisations have taken on  increasingly distributed structures, a shift from a long-standing  tradition of vertical integration.

## Product Flow Options

<img width="1919" height="951" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a4f6236-d53d-40e6-8b70-e14bbb8352b4" />

- All right. Now, let's think about product flow options. When you think about the whole spectrum of what a supply chain could look like, one of the extremes would be vertical integration. Vertical integration means that the company is the whole supply chain start to finish. Or you have companies that just focus on their core competencies, and you orchestrate the supply chain, but you don't necessarily perform all of the different tasks. Traditionally, if you think back to the origins of, for example, the Ford Motor Company, the Model T, which was one of the all-time best-selling cars ever, was built entirely by Ford. So you had rubber, you had wood and yet iron-ore, were the three main ingredients, and all of the little components that the car was being built out of were done internally in the Ford Motor Company.
- Then at the other end, you actually have the finished car come out. On the other hand, you have also a very successful company today, which is Apple, which does not manufacturer a single one of their products. But they have very tight control over their entire supply chain, and they pick partners that will do certain tasks for them. They really just are like a conductor of an orchestra. They give everyone the direction in which they need to move, and they very carefully monitor what everybody does. The conductor of an orchestra does not play a single instrument him or herself. So if you are in the vertical integration category, you have to learn how to d o everything really, really well.
- Otherwise, the total is going to be not very good. You're not going to be very competitive. On the other hand, if you focus just on core competency, you have to get better at the things you're already doing well. Which is also not necessarily very easy because, if you're already pretty good at them, it's not as easy to get better at them. So that's the spectrum of things. Within that spectrum, every company has to figure out how much vertical integration we have, how much do we focus on core competency, and you'll be somewhere in the middle. You can't completely say, "I just orchestrate and everybody else does parts for me."
- Probably, in today's world, you can't just focus on vertical integration altogether. Neither of the extremes is very feasible. You'll have to find your niche of doing some parts yourself, and doing some parts by managing others, and find exactly the right way in between. How do you pick? Well, on the vertical integration side, we have capabilities and resources in play that enable you to be vertically integrated, at least in part of your supply chain. That's a question that is not that easy to answer. On the core competency side, we have providers that are very good at it.
- Can you achieve efficiency by letting others do certain parts? Since you're relying on third party, can you be competitive? Do you have enough unique things that you do internally to stand out compared to your competitors? Because if anybody could just copy you, then it'd be very easy to do things as good, if not, better than you.

## Product Flow Strategy

- Now let's talk about product flow strategy. Well, when we look at strategy for the whole company, there are several levels until we get to our supply chain strategy. Then even from then on until we get to product flow strategy specifically. So at the corporate level, we have to ask the question, how do we get where we want to be as a company? Then that is going to drive the marketing strategy questions, who are our customers and what to result to them? Based on answers to those questions, then we can think about what should procurement look like, what should manufacturing look like, what should logistics look like. So supply chain strategy is one or two steps, it's really two steps away from your overall corporate strategy, and inevitably those are going to be linked.
- Now, when we get to executing that strategy, there are going to be certain opportunities that you can take advantage of and you have to have certain resources in place in order to take advantage of those opportunities. Only that interplay between those two things is going to yield a good strategy or is going to be the result of a good strategy. So when we think about how products should flow through our supply chain, what kind of resources do we have in place, what can we take advantage of, and what opportunities do we see? By making changes over time, are we able to take advantage of let's say new markets or new customers and so on. So there's always this interplay of what can we hope to accomplish and what do we have in terms of accomplishing those goals.

## Nike Manufacturing and Supply Chain Strategies

Delivery precision is important for a multi-product and multi-jurisdictional company like Nike, Inc. (
NKE
).  It improves margins, lowers inventories, minimizes price markdowns, and  makes sure that the customer receives the right product on time. Nike’s  manufacturing network has over 525 factories in 40 countries. Products  move from several distribution centers across a network of thousands of  retail accounts.

## Product Flow Issues

- All right, now let's talk about identifying product flow issues. One of the easiest way to identify issues in the supply chain in general is to ask the following question, what matters to the customer? And if there is a disconnect between the promises we made to customer and how we're keeping those promises. Then it's going to be something that needs to be fixed. So if the customer notices a problem then we have to fix it, and that's usually the first line. If we promise our customer that the order will be there on a Thursday, it better be there on a Thursday. If it arrives on Friday, then we have a problem.
- That should in and of itself prompt us to look for why was the product not there when we promised our customers it would be there. So then you can step back and say, all right, so if it arrived a day late, why did it arrived a day late? When did the truck leave our warehouse? Well, it left a day late. Okay, so then there wasn't a trucking issue but maybe a warehousing issue. Well, why did it not leave on the correct day? Maybe it didn't arrive at the warehouse on time or some piece was missing there.
- So then we work backwards and backwards, and backward until we identify the root cause of the problem that impacted the customer. So, when we think about our product flow, it's typically things that impact the customer. Or the next level underneath that would be things that could have impacted the customer, but didn't. And only through somebody's intervention where we able to make it so that the customer didn't notice. That doesn't make the the issue go away necessarily, but at least that sort of under the radar. It is important to also capture those types of issues as well. Then the next type of issue would be things that happen at let's see, your supplier that didn't impact us. But we can then work backwards and see what we can do to fix those issues.

## Types of Product Flow Issues

- So now let's talk about the types of issues that you might look for or find, and it's actually quite easy to summarize. Usually the issues relate to cost, product quality, or service quality. So cost, obviously, something costs more than it should have, we don't achieve the financial results we're looking for. And very often when it comes to improving your supply chain as you trying to engineer cost out of that supply chain. So are there different ways of doing things, doing things more efficiently so that we can take out cost? Also, if it comes to, let's say, delivery issues, we had to expedite order so that the customer would notice, that, again, goes back to to cost, it's a cost issue that wasn't fixed. The next type of issue is the product quality issue, so products didn't perform as well as they're supposed to.
- Customers are noticing they're not as good as they should be and, therefore, There's something in the product flow that didn't work well enough. The third type of issue would be a service quality issue. So it has to do with delivery timeliness, accuracy of filling those orders, all of those service metrics that we talked about previously. And why are those things not up to the promise of what we told the customer to expect? So it's, again, promise making and promise keeping. So generally, the vast majority of supply chain issues, as they are related to product, fall into these three categories, cost, product quality, and service quality.

###########################################################################################################
###########################################################################################################
###########################################################################################################

## Analysis of Issues

Now let's talk about how you would go about analyzing issues. I'll stick with our three categories; costs, product quality, and service quality. So amongst cost, we have a whole host of cost loads, input costs, those are costs caused by our suppliers, inventory cost, production costs, and delivery cost. Drilling down into this issue of costs are too high or we need to save money or engineer costs out of the supply chain, those are the general areas in which you would look at things. Why are raw materials more than they should be? For example, our competitors are able to get the same raw materials for less. Okay. Let's work with our suppliers to figure out what we need to do to get our raw materials cheaper. 
Inventory costs are typically driven by inventories being too high. Do we have to carry that much inventory in our supply chain? If not, we're able to save on inventory cost. Production costs, making our products, are there things that we're doing that are not as efficient which make our per unit cost go up? Then let's find a way to fix those. Then, finally delivery cost, does it cost us more than our competitors to deliver our products to the customers? If it does, how do we fix those? 
Now, when we talk about product quality. There's really two aspects to it. One is the raw material quality and the second one is manufacturing quality. Raw materials obviously, the inputs that go into our products and then manufacturing is what type of transformation we do to those products to make them look like the final assembled goods that we are selling. So root causes of quality can be in either one of these categories, and those are the typical areas you would look for quality issues. Then finally, service quality. There's usually three steps. 
One is forecasting, the second one is inventory, and the third one is delivery. All three are connected. If you don't forecast right, you're not going to hold the right level of inventory, your delivery is not going to be off the right mix of products that the customer was looking for. So very often, delivery issues are caused by poor forecast. Now if you don't translate the forecast into the right inventory, well, then there's the disconnect right there. Then you delivery is not going to happen properly. Or sometimes you just have pure delivery issues, you might have forecasted well, had to right inventory but something in the late delivery didn't go well, and that's what the customer notices. 
So looking at service quality, it is very important because that's often something that companies are not doing as well. So the frequency in which you could have delivery issues can be quite high.

## Take Great Strides with Gemba Walks

Gemba is a Japanese word meaning the place where value is created. In  construction, it would be the job site. In the insurance industry, the  gemba is the claims processing center. At a logistics company, the  warehouse or fulfillment center is the gemba. In manufacturing, it’s the  shop floor.

## Designing Solutions

Now let's talk about how you would think about designing solutions. And one of the most commonly used tools to derive solutions for issues, is to map out the supply chain. And there are three general types of maps that you can draw of your supply chain. One is a relationship map, so that is who is in your supply chain, who are your suppliers, who are you customer? What does that relationship itself look like? Then there is a process map and typically those process maps are time based. So what activities occur in what order and in what sequence? 
And then finally there's an inventory map, so how do you turn raw materials inventory into finished goods? There are multiple steps in between, and then how much inventory do you have at each stage? So next I'll show you examples of all of those, but those are your equal types of mapping. The reason why getting to a solutions often goes through mapping is because you want to visualize a process. And by visualizing the process then you're able to think about where are possible areas where the issue really occurs, finding the root cause in other words. And by finding the root cause, then you're able to sort of take a step back and say, well, what if we did things differently, then we could come up with with a solution that's working. Looking just at number sometimes doesn't tell you the whole picture, which is why I'm a strong advocate of these mapping type of approaches. 
But to me, sort of looking at things graphically is always the first step.

## Mapping Solutions

So now let's look at mapping in a little bit more detail. First of relationship map. The questions you ask in a relationship map, who is in the supply chain? That's really what you're trying to figure out. Where are the customer? Who's the focal company and competitors, who are suppliers and who are other service providers? Those are all the different categories of companies that you need to have in there. 
The other part of the question is, what distinct supply chains do we have? Do we have different supply chains for different product lines? Maybe it's a larger company with multiple divisions and each really has their own specific supply chain. Just visualizing all of that is going to help you really figure out what kind of relationships are in there, maybe who you need to integrate a little bit more closely. Those types of maps are really going to help you answer more higher-level strategic questions versus some of the other maps which are much more operationally-focused. But if it's sort of a higher-level strategy type question, that would be the first step. A time-based process map is going to look at specific steps in the process, the sequence of those steps and, because it's time-based, the time for each step. 
You can then determine which step is using how much time and you might also be able to put some qualitative judgment on each step and say all right, how much time do we actually add value to this product and how much is not spent adding value? If you just get rid of the non-value added time, then your process in and of itself is actually going to be a lot more efficient. Then in an inventory map, you're looking at again a process and how much inventory you have in each state. So inventory gets transformed throughout the process but how much do you have at each level and do you have the right amount of inventory because that could also be something that is out of tune with the goals of your process. So if you have too much in one area and not enough in the other, if it's not really balanced, then that's a sign that something is wrong with the process which you wouldn't detect on a time-based process map because that's just time spent but it could also correspond because if a lot of inventory because there's a lot of waiting going on. So you have to look at both of those. Often in conjunction, they tell you a more holistic picture on the operational side. 
So as I mentioned before, the relationship map is a higher level strategy map and then for more specific problems than a process map in an inventory map would tell you more operationally-focused perspective.

## Mapping Example

So now that we talked about different mapping approaches, let me also show you some examples of these approaches. So the first one is a relationship map, and this is a fast food chain. Typically, when you think about fast food type of restaurants here you have some kind of meat branch, in this case beef, very often french fries are part of it, so there's a potato branch. Sometimes you have toys because you also want to attract kids to the tier chain. So those go through different types of distributors, those distributors then we'll move the product to franchisees, and if it's a franchise type of fast food chain, who then sell to customers. Typically, when you have things like food ingredients, it actually is a very sequential supply chain because it goes through various suppliers and sort of the beef becomes in the form of what you're going to serve in a restaurant. There are multiple suppliers and it's typically a fairly tight lock down sequence especially for beef supply chains. 
You don't have multiple Tier 1 suppliers or multiple Tier 2 supplier, partly it's for control and for tracing. If there are issues with food products, you want to have more control over that. At least in this example, there are other ones but this one is a very tightly close down example. Now here is a time-based process map and this was before they took out some approaches to change things. So here we see in green is the activity time, and then red is all the wasted time. So when you look at your supply chain process in this case, it is a manufacturing type of process. You see each one of the steps for the goods come in, you book the job in, you set up the job, you degrease, you etch and plate, you deembrittle, you polish, inspect, book out, pack, dispatch. 
All of those activities have different time associated with them and you need to sort of figure out how much is the actual activity and how much are those products just waiting around. Just visually looking at it, the majority of those almost 70 hours that are spent doing this process are wasted time, non-active time. So you would be able to shorten the time it takes to perform all of that work by a significant amount just by going in and shrinking the wasted time down hopefully to zero but at least to make it significantly less. Lastly, there's this supply chain inventory map, so where you have from raw material through the different stages of the supply chain up until it hits the end-user, and you see that the different states of the product ultimately come at different levels. So in some cases we have five days of inventory and the other we have 20 days of inventory. If you're looking at it from a lean perspective, everything should be as small as possible. So the 20 days that's a huge amount of waste. 
Ideally, you want it to be as little as possible. If you are a little bit more relaxed about the lean assumption, maybe 10-20 days is fine but even then, you probably want to have your buffers to be as small as possible. So those are the three different types of mapping which I think is often a very good start to find improvements.

## Leading Change

- Now, on our journey to build a Product Flow Strategy, we're getting to the point where we have our solution and now it's about affecting and leading change. When it comes to change management and there's generic change management models that you can find all over the place, there are really a couple of critical steps that you have to go through to really mobilize the correct teams in the organization. So the very first one is to create a sense of urgency. Why is it that people need to take action at this point if there is no sense of urgency? Everybody has a job, everybody's busy. Why do they need to act now? That is the first step in convincing that you as the leader of a project has to accomplish.
- Once you create that sense of urgency, then you have to build support. You have to find people who you are convinced that your approach is the correct one and necessary and then if this becomes something that the company has to do, they are going to be out there and agree with you and support you. Next, you have to display a vision. What is it that we're going to be able to do at the end of this process and you have to get everyone started and get them to move in the same direction, after which you finish up by institutionalizing the whole product process and whatever the state was before is now going to be changed and you're moving in a different direction. Then the next time you want to affect change, you start again with sense of urgency, support vision get started and then institutionalize. Like I said before, there are other ways of setting it up. This is a very generic one that you can use.
- But one of the things that you have to realize, the first three steps have nothing to do with actually affecting the change. It's all about setting things up and making sure everybody understands the direction and the importance of this project before you actually ask them to do anything differently.

## Motivation and Leadership

- So now let's talk about Motivation and Leadership. One of the important things that a leader has to do is to motivate people. And psychologically that can be done through a couple of steps. But first you have to show people that there's something missing, there are things that need to be done that haven't been done yet. Those things are going to drive people forward and then lead to learning, and that new learning is going to really be the change that is happening and that's going to lead to different behaviors and finally you achieve the goal. So it's state six different steps on the way to achieving the goal. But as a leader you have to spend time and make sure all of these things are in place for you to be an effective leader and for people to follow along in your journey.
- The other part that you have to realize before you as a leader get to the desired outcome, everything has a specific contest that you need to be aware of. There are specific people that you need to be in place to follow you and order to achieve the outcomes you want. So you have to be cognizant that you can just operate in a vacuum or just with your followers, but there's context and specific outcomes you want to accomplish. And all of those things have to be in balance for you to be an effective leader?

###########################################################################################################
###########################################################################################################
###########################################################################################################

## Implementing Change

- So now for the last lecture, let's talk about implementation. And here's another process for you. And we had that in there, it's one of the classic Lean Six Sigma tool. In order to implement change, you have to first define the problem, measure it, analyze it, implement it, and then you can control it over time. Now, this is a standard process and when you look at all of the different tools that we talked about earlier, they might fit into these previous category. But implementation obviously is when everything comes together and you accomplish your goals. Now when you try to effect change, having one of these process models in place is going to a, make sure everybody's disciplined.
- They go through each step and they understand that one step has to be completed before you move on to the next. But you also have to be very careful that people don't get lost in the maze. So having something like this is going to keep everybody back on track and one of the critical things with supply chain management is, or everybody has a job. And those jobs will keep people busy and effecting changes typically not in people's job descriptions. So you have to be always very cognizant that status quo is most convenient for everybody. So a cat is not going to be likely to move unless it has to and change is difficult. I also didn't say herding dogs
- Dogs like learning new tricks, cats not so much. It's important to have incentives for the different people. If people aren't incented and incentives can come in various ways. If those incentives are not in place, it's unlikely that people are necessarily going to act. You have to have a way to make it worth people's time. And finally, accountability is one of the more important things in this. If you can't hold people accountable, then what is their incentive to really change things?

###########################################################################################################
###########################################################################################################
###########################################################################################################

## Information Flow Strategy

- Now, let's talk about information flow strategy. One of the key things that we have to do is, when we are trying to improve our strategy of how we use information in the supply chain to have a proper planning process. You may have seen this before, but you have to focus on what the problem is, you have to analyze the issues, you have to plan, execute, and then refine. It's really a circular thing because as you make improvements, new things come to light and it becomes a fairly consistently reoccurring theme that there's always something else that you need to work on. So planning is critical, and often having somebody who's driving just that project, is becoming indispensable. So you always have to start with planning the process.

###########################################################################################################
###########################################################################################################
###########################################################################################################

## Information Flow Options

- So now let's talk about some information flow options. And the spectrum really ranges from proprietary information technology, locally has hosted, fully customized, to a software as a service or even infrastructure is a service. Best of breed type system where you plug and play different types of system as you see fit with a very low upfront investment, which are typically paper use based. And when we look at how a lot of information technology has gone, we are moving away from the proprietary type of systems towards the hosted services. So it'll be interesting to see how companies that have made significant investments in their SAP system and a lot of locally hosted and customized solution are able to transition into more of a cloud-based infrastructure. Now, the cloud-based infrastructure is great for younger startups who can just plug them in and use them right away. But it'll be interesting how these large companies are going to react to it overall.
- Now, how to pick, it really becomes a make versus buy type decision. Even though the propriety systems you don't program yourself, but you're investing so much of your own resources into making them work that it almost feels like a make versus buy decision. So, on the hosted service side, you have to see what providers are available, what efficiencies that they can bring you, and how competitive they are to something that you could do yourself. And if they are good options, then that's probably where you should lean towards. However, if you have the capability and the resources to build something yourself and use it in a way that provides you with a competitive advantage, then that may actually pull you more in that direction. And each type of system can sort of be its own decision. You don't have to go full host and hosted services or proprietary, so you can mix and match. And it can also be an evolution over time that you moved to more hosted services if that seems to be the way you should go. 

###########################################################################################################
###########################################################################################################
###########################################################################################################

## Planning for Information Flow

- So now let's talk a little bit about strategy. One of the key things to realize when it comes to information flow strategy is that you are trying to support what is not only going on in the supply chain, specific activities you're doing procurement and manufacturing and logistics, but also has to meet a higher strategy or a higher level of strategy and what do you sell to your customers? What are you promising them and how you're accomplishing those promises. So you're supporting physical activities that go on in the supply chain that meet a marketing goal and ultimately reach a corporate goal. So it's definitely supportive. It's not the end-all be-all, but you have to be very clear about you're trying to make physical activities better in your supply chain. So that's the main goal that you are supporting with information.
- Now, how to accomplish that? While you have to give people better information, you have to be able to recognize when things are not going as well by having data to see things. The data usually provides visibility and that's a very important concept. If you don't have the data for something that means you're flying blind. So where can we make things better? Well, usually it's fairly straightforward to find where opportunities lie. The key thing is do you have the resources to work on those things?
- Usually, it's a priorities type of discussion of, do we get to work on certain things now, or is it down the line? Clearly, you have to identify the right opportunities or the best opportunities and then use your resources in such a way that they can make a difference.

## Types of Information Flow Issues

- So now let me give you a little bit of an overview of the types of issues that you might encounter or might want to look for regarding information. The key things are, it's the three As, Availability, Accuracy and Accessibility. So when we talk about availability, do we have that data available somewhere? If you don't have it available one project you could do is to work on how to get that data. Second is Accuracy, is the the data that we have accurate and if there's accuracy issues that are holding us back from making better decisions, then that would be something to fix. And the last one is Accessibility, if we can't get to the data or if the data in the way it is currently stored is not usable. Then that's represents a problem comes back to availability and we might have it but if it's not accessible, it's like we didn't even have it. So those are the three main things to look for when it comes to information issues.

## Analysis of Information Issues

- So now that we have the types of issues, how do we go about analyzing them? There's something to be said about not having data available. So typically, when we look at the supply chain, there are blind spots, and the more blind spots you have, the more issues they create. Ultimately blind spots mean that there's an issue somewhere and it's going to carry through in the supply chain, and all of a sudden, it's going to impact the customer and that's a bad thing. So getting access to data or getting some visibility into a part of the supply chain is definitely necessary. Now, all of the data that we have is backwards-focused, but the more real-time data we get, and the more forward-looking, we not have to drive our car by looking in the rear view mirror, which is a hard way of driving. Accuracy, that's a very simple thing.
- Well, if you have wrong data, even if your analysis is right, it's going to lead to bad decisions. So you need to work very hard to make sure your data is correct because then with correct analysis, you're going to make good decisions. So accuracy is an obvious and very important thing to keep in mind. Then lastly, accessibility. So people don't necessarily have access to data, that's like not having the data. So it becomes a blind spot. Now there's always the risk or the security question, should you give people access to all the data?
- That's a whole another discussion, that's reserved for somewhere else. But if the people who need to use certain data don't have access to it, that's creates a problem. The other one is, if the format is so difficult to use that they have to spend a lot of time and cleaning the data, they might not have that time to clean the data, so they might shy away from using it and make decisions in another way without using data, and that again causes a problem. So you have to be aware of both of those pieces within accessibility of data. A lot of organizations will have all kinds of these issues that I just talked about, availability, accuracy and accessibility issues. So if you're in that line of information and the supply chain, you'll probably find a lot of projects to work on to improve things.

## Designing Information Solutions

- Now, let's talk about designing solutions. So we spend some time in this course talking about forecasting, but we didn't talk about forecasting in general. So how do you go through the whole step of forecasting? So there are three phases and there are certain things that you need to do in each phase. All three phases are important when you implement a forecast or develop a forecasting solution. So there's a preparation phase, there's the modeling phase, and then there's the implementation phase. I'll talk about each one of these phases in some detail, but you'll see here the specific steps are you formulate the problem, you collect the data, you manipulate and clean the data.
- Then you go into model, you build the model, you evaluate the model. Then you go into the implementation phase and implement the model and evaluate the forecasts. Then ultimately that's where we spend some time unless you have to go back and revise and which case you would go back to building the model and evaluating them, implementing and so on.

## Designing Forecast Solutions : Prepare

- Now let's start by preparing our forecasting solution. So defining the problem, which to a lot of you might seem a little bit weird. Why do you need to spend so much time formulating problem? The problem is simple. You want to build a forecast, but you have to start by asking a few of these questions: why is a forecast needed? Who will use the forecasts? What are their specific requirements?
- What level of detail or aggregation is required? What's the time horizon? What data do we have available? Because if you don't ask these questions beforehand, you might go off create a forecast that nobody really needs or uses. So that would be a bad thing. So can you keep these five questions in mind because they typically get to the root of the issue and that will then help you move on in a better direction. Then after that, you go and collect data.
- We've mostly focused on historical demand, although in a lot of companies you might use that as a baseline forecast and then add in market and competitor information, maybe your promotional plans, or other factors that impact the demand. Sometimes companies have used weather or other types of event type of information, where you know that there's a big event in a certain area, it's going to drive demand. So as we have to look at a whole host of data and see what's available, what we can get, and what comes in a usable form for you to then put into your forecast. Then you move into data manipulation and cleaning. You get data sometimes from multiple sources, you format it, you find missing data, you look for outliers, remove them, so then when you are ready to forecast and apply your forecasting techniques, that environment that you work in, that spreadsheet is going to have the right data put in the right way. So you don't have to go through and dig up stuff, or you're forecasting methods don't work because the data is unaligned properly and all of that. So these would be the four things you look for when you have the data and you start preparing it for implementing a forecast.

## Designing Forecast Solutions: Model

- So the next phase of building a forecasting solution is to model. By building a model I mean you could take it as I've learned five, six different methods, I'm going to apply all of them. Certainly with five or six methods you can do that and then determine what is best but each method is going to have a different assumption on what drives demand. In other words, is you have a story of how demand is created, and what you want to do is create multiple of these stories because you don't necessarily know which one is the truth and then test them against each other and pick the best one. So yes, you want to build multiple models. You don't want to necessarily build every model under the sun. So you want to be a little picky and with experience you'll learn what drives demand anyway, so it's going to be a shorter list as you get more experience.
- Then you look into which model is good, which is better, and then finally pick the best one. Picking the best one is a little bit subjective, but we talked about forecast accuracy and you can use those to guide your thinking. When you get a forecast with the lowest mean squared error, that's usually a good candidate. You may look if it's too biased or if two methods are close in mean squared error, you might want to use some of the other methods to be a tiebreaker, but typically you would look at accuracy and hopefully it works out. The other thing that you can do is let's say you have three years of data, you could use the first three years to build a model and then use one year as a holdout period. Don't train your model, don't build your model on that, just see how it works with brand new data. That particularly if you're looking at, let's say exponential smoothing with different types of coefficients, that might work better if you have a whole that piece of data to see how different values of Alpha would do.

## Designing Forecast Solutions: Implement

- And then finally we get to implementing our forecasting solution. So when you implement the model you apply it to real data. However, you don't necessarily know how it's going to work out. So especially in the beginning we're ready for the big stage, you have to monitor it very carefully and make sure that you didn't pick the wrong thing. Or that there's something unforeseen that you didn't take into account. So you have to be very careful in this phase, once you establish a forecast and it seems to produce pretty good results over time, you can sit back a little bit and enjoy the show. But you want to be very careful, especially when he first implement a model.
- And the other thing is that over time you might feel the need to take your initial model, you tested it a couple times. And you might feel the need to revise it and come up with a better model and it's sort of an ongoing thing when you have a forecasting model. Because ultimately each forecasting approach is geared towards certain assumptions. And once those assumptions don't hold you're going to have to use something different. So it's not, I don't want to set the mindset that once you pick a forecast it's there forever, it requires continuous evaluation.

## Leading Change

- Now, on our journey to build a Product Flow Strategy, we're getting to the point where we have our solution and now it's about affecting and leading change. When it comes to change management and there's generic change management models that you can find all over the place, there are really a couple of critical steps that you have to go through to really mobilize the correct teams in the organization. So the very first one is to create a sense of urgency. Why is it that people need to take action at this point if there is no sense of urgency? Everybody has a job, everybody's busy. Why do they need to act now? That is the first step in convincing that you as the leader of a project has to accomplish.
- Once you create that sense of urgency, then you have to build support. You have to find people who you are convinced that your approach is the correct one and necessary and then if this becomes something that the company has to do, they are going to be out there and agree with you and support you. Next, you have to display a vision. What is it that we're going to be able to do at the end of this process and you have to get everyone started and get them to move in the same direction, after which you finish up by institutionalizing the whole product process and whatever the state was before is now going to be changed and you're moving in a different direction. Then the next time you want to affect change, you start again with sense of urgency, support vision get started and then institutionalize. Like I said before, there are other ways of setting it up. This is a very generic one that you can use.
- But one of the things that you have to realize, the first three steps have nothing to do with actually affecting the change. It's all about setting things up and making sure everybody understands the direction and the importance of this project before you actually ask them to do anything differently.

## Motivation and Leadership

- So now let's talk about Motivation and Leadership. One of the important things that a leader has to do is to motivate people. And psychologically that can be done through a couple of steps. But first you have to show people that there's something missing, there are things that need to be done that haven't been done yet. Those things are going to drive people forward and then lead to learning, and that new learning is going to really be the change that is happening and that's going to lead to different behaviors and finally you achieve the goal. So it's state six different steps on the way to achieving the goal. But as a leader you have to spend time and make sure all of these things are in place for you to be an effective leader and for people to follow along in your journey.
- The other part that you have to realize before you as a leader get to the desired outcome, everything has a specific contest that you need to be aware of. There are specific people that you need to be in place to follow you and order to achieve the outcomes you want. So you have to be cognizant that you can just operate in a vacuum or just with your followers, but there's context and specific outcomes you want to accomplish. And all of those things have to be in balance for you to be an effective leader?

## Implementing Change

- So now for the last lecture, let's talk about implementation. And here's another process for you. And we had that in there, it's one of the classic Lean Six Sigma tool. In order to implement change, you have to first define the problem, measure it, analyze it, implement it, and then you can control it over time. Now, this is a standard process and when you look at all of the different tools that we talked about earlier, they might fit into these previous category. But implementation obviously is when everything comes together and you accomplish your goals. Now when you try to effect change, having one of these process models in place is going to a, make sure everybody's disciplined.
- They go through each step and they understand that one step has to be completed before you move on to the next. But you also have to be very careful that people don't get lost in the maze. So having something like this is going to keep everybody back on track and one of the critical things with supply chain management is, or everybody has a job. And those jobs will keep people busy and effecting changes typically not in people's job descriptions. So you have to be always very cognizant that status quo is most convenient for everybody. So a cat is not going to be likely to move unless it has to and change is difficult. I also didn't say herding dogs.
- Dogs like learning new tricks, cats not so much. It's important to have incentives for the different people. If people aren't incented and incentives can come in various ways. If those incentives are not in place, it's unlikely that people are necessarily going to act. You have to have a way to make it worth people's time. And finally, accountability is one of the more important things in this. If you can't hold people accountable, then what is their incentive to really change things?
