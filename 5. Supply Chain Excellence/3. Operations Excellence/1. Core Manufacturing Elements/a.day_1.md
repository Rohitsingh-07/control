- Now let's move over to the next part of our internal product flow journeys. So we talked about inbound product flow now let's talk about what happens within the four walls of the company, and let's get started with manufacturing efficiency. So when you think about just philosophically manufacturing efficiency can, there's always a cost and a benefits calculation that you have to make. So if you are trying to be efficient you want to get the greatest benefit at the lowest cost possible, and that's not always very easy to accomplish because a company has to manufacture the product. That's a standard that always has to be there and incrementally over time you can only figure out, how do I make things a little bit better and a little bit smoother to extract the most benefit at the least amount of costs? I mean, you could say I'll try to keep the cost fixed and then get a better product or more product or I can find ways to lower costs overall, but ultimately there's some movement that can make but most often companies see that gains are very incremental.

## Manufacturing Systems

<img width="1919" height="952" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9418bbd1-8f7e-4a7b-89ec-95e5843a09f4" />

- Now let's talk about Manufacturing Systems, when it comes to systems of manufacturing. There are really three big camps, if you will, that are going to really become options of what you might choose. Now in reality. We have to realize that in most companies you're going to have a mix of things. So, maybe a mix of lean and agile or some agile features, some lean features or economies of scale. And, what I would like to do is just talk about each one of those three general categories of systems and then I'll give you an example on each one of them. So, let's start with agile, agile manufacturing is very flexible and fast and responsive.
- So, you're not really assuming that something specific, will happen in terms of demand or demand for certain types of products. You just ready for whichever option. Customers may choose and you would then also be able to change over time and, accomplish the same just with a set of resources that is not really fixed and scope. Now when we look at a lean manufacturing system, it is responsive to customer demand. So, it speeds up and slows down with customer demand, but you don't have a large variety of products you have one. Product per line and that line is just going to go faster or slower depending on what customer demand is doing, its efficient in that there is no waste but it is also responsive to changes of customer demand. That doesn't necessarily mean that it is good at making those adaptation because when it speeds up it probably has a very narrow operating range however, you still have the ability to go faster or slower versus a economy of scale type system.

<img width="1919" height="915" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2aae7fb9-8e21-422c-9547-0a73e3e1d109" />

- Typically it's characterized by being quite large, very consistent, you doing the same steps over and over and over and you drive efficiency from that size and that consistency. So, by manufacturing a lot your per unit cost is going to be as low as possible. Now, let's do one example and I'll give you a automotive example for an agile manufacturing system. And that's, BMW and I didn't want to pick an automotive example for lean because lean is always connected to it Toyota. So, I have a different example for you there. But, BMW makes cars that are completely customized to a customer's order, so you could go in and say I want my car to have this option in this color, etc, etc, etc. And, they will build that just for you, now, internally on each one of their manufacturing line.
- They have the ability to manufacture multiple models. So, one could be a sedan one could be a convertible, one could be a station wagon and they all go down the same line and their workers are able to handle different tasks for different vehicles without any real issue and the speed of the system is derived by using just in time inventory approaches, but they also are using a different system for some raw materials called just in sequence. It doesn't mean that replenishments are delivered in small quantity. It might be larger quantity, but they already have planned out which options each car will have ahead of time. So then, the sequence in which the replenishments are ordered and delivered are going to correspond by what model they're planning to build, so you could, for example, order a brand new car and they can build it for you in less than a month. So, the responsiveness is derived from the fact that cars are customer ordered and right up until the car gets on the line a customer could change their mind and have a completely different set of options if necessary and one of the things that often happens dealers have models in the pipeline and they'll have sort of a standard model that they might just put on their lot and if a customer wants that model, up until the last minute they can modify it and give the customer exactly what they're looking for. So, this would be one type of manufacturing system.

<img width="1919" height="942" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c41e00ae-cd06-4ff8-afac-ab23f8ee7724" />

- Let me give you a lean example and this time I'll pick a hospital, lean is very popular in the United States in the medical industry. Especially, hospital are looking at lean to become more efficient. So, responsiveness, each patient case is different. So, they are going to react very different leave to one patient versus another each therapy is different. So, depending on the patient and the therapy that is best for them, they are customizing how that service, because that's ultimately what it is, is delivered to the patient. Efficiency is one of the main goals, a lot of hospitals even though health care in the United States specifically is very expensive are trying to find ways to save cost not saying they're very successful at it yet, but that is very often one of the major goal for hospitals, but it's also one of those industries where you can make pretty large gains if you increase your efficiency, and no waste you can see that because in certain types of procedures wait times can really make a big difference, especially in critical situations. So, by being able to take out waste out of the system, you can also really streamline the outcomes for a patient.

<img width="1916" height="940" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e5c5b58-782f-4903-844b-cfb9db733e0b" />

- And then finally, let's talk about a economy of scale example, and that would be Apple's manufacturing system. If you look at the iPhone, the iPhone is typically been assembled in one large facility that basically manages worldwide production of the iPhone. They're producing millions and millions of the same product. That size enables them to be efficient because everything is under one roof. Everything is controlled, you're cranking out so many products that each product's individual cost can be reduced also, it's very consistent. Apple is smart in the fact that they have a very limited line of products. They're not too many choices.
- And, if you look at Apple over time, they've added varieties very slowly and carefully and I think that was partly due to the fact that they had this economies of scale approach. They wanted to have massive quantities, and now that the company keeps growing and growing they can diversify and have different options. And, then finally it is efficient. They are very careful in how they manage each part of the process how they manage each worker and the output they achieve and they always keep improving their efficiency. So, that is one of the major focuses of their contract manufacturers.

## Agile versus Lean versus Scale

<img width="1919" height="945" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6738467f-8352-41d7-855b-5a1f816485d5" />

- So now let's follow along on our journey throughout manufacturing efficiency, and let's compare agile versus lean versus scale approaches. So how do you really decide? As I mentioned earlier, you typically pick and choose the general system that is most appropriate for your environment. That environment includes the type of industry you're in specifically, the type of product you're in and you also are trying to add overtime features of the other extremes that might complement what you're doing pretty well. So for example, when I kind of characterized BMW as an agile manufacturer, they're a luxury automaker. Their customers have very distinct expectations of their product and one of them is to have the choice and the customizability that you can make the car pretty much your own versus, let's say, a lean approach wouldn't allow that much customizability. Then we have Apple on the other extreme that is building basically, the same product over and over and over.
- They are also a luxury product manufacturer, however, they got their customers to buy into the concept that we know exactly what features and what options you really need and we give you exactly that. Those of you who may remember back before Apple had its resurgence and became popular again, the biggest computer maker back then was Dell and Dell offered the full host of options and you can pick and choose exactly the type of computer you wanted and then Apple came in and said we'll give you a few option. Here is the best, the middle of the ground and the cheapest and you pick from them and even if it doesn't have exactly the options you may want, it's going to fulfill your needs exactly the way you want it. So there's always a dominant part and then companies are trying to add features from the other approaches.

## Contract Manufacturers

<img width="1919" height="935" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e56c31e-44b0-4c3c-92e8-471167371fd2" />

- Now let's talk about contract manufacturers and contract manufacturers are an interesting breed of companies because in many ways you have An extension of your own company because they actually manufacture products for you. But on the other hand it basically becomes another supplier. So the decision whether to use a contract manufacturer or not is a very generic one. It's the make versus by that. Does it make sense to to really do it? So on on the make side and I had cost as the above the higher first in each approach, but when you think about it You can be better than anybody at producing your own product or you can find a contract manufacturer that helps you save costs. If you're not very good at making something yourself.4
- If you can go to a contract manufacturer and save a lot of money, but you could be very efficient and making your own product. And in that sense, you would never save any money because you're the best at making this product. So cost. It really depends on whether it's better to make or buy second on the pro for making your own product. You can control quality eggs much better if its internal because you're running the whole manufacturing system, you can design the whole system to produce high-quality and it also at the same time offers you the flexibility and the uniqueness of doing something that nobody else can can get so if your company has advantages in that then it might be a good thing to do versus on the buy side you are going to be able to get lower volumes at a competitive price where you maybe don't need necessarily the economies of scale because that contract manufacturer might be building the same product for multiple customers. So they already build that economy of scale and for a smaller volume, they might be able to be very competitive and they might also have an easier time scaling up and down. Risk can be differentiated.
- If for example you have multiple contract manufacturers producing the same thing, then you can spread out risk. And if you have a fairly large size, then you can use that power to negotiate pretty good deals. So there's pros and cons on each side, but every company has to go through that decision. Structure themselves and figure out whether making products or buying them from contract manufacturers is the best way forward. Now an interesting question that always comes up with contract manufacturers. Well, is it easier to manage? An external provider versus an internal department and when you look at this question on the face of it, you most people probably would say internal.

<img width="1919" height="918" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06317812-87c4-4a3e-b460-dc8fea5c6a25" />

- Because they're part of your company. Why wouldn't it be easier to manage and makes a lot of sense that it should be easier? But it also comes down to the incentive structure very often internal departments. What is their incentive to really be responsive to customers versus an external service provider that always has that threat of having the contract discontinued. They might be a lot more customer-friendly. So as we have to take that distinction in addition, you also have to realize how easy it is to work with an external so many factoring provider versus an internal manufacturing division one or the other might actually be easier to work with it's not always the case that the internal manufacturing division that's going to be easy to work with they might have other incentive. That are not necessarily aligned with yours.
- So it's an interesting question about who is easier to manage and there are good arguments on either side and I'm not really taking one position or another. I just want to point out that very much depends on the specifics.

## Manufacturing Excellence

<img width="1919" height="954" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c846b58-f8ca-4c4e-b94b-f54edac4bb79" />

- Now let's put everything together and talk about manufacturing excellence. So the question of which manufacturing strategy is right for your company, it really has to fit into the whole supply chain that you have. Internally, we always talk about source, make, and deliver. It also has to match up with a corporate strategy. So whatever the company wants to accomplish that has to match up from source, to make, to deliver. So there's nothing necessarily too specific that makes your manufacturing stands out. But ultimately, the goal has to be execute the overall corporate strategy.
- However, that is accomplished, that's the right manufacturing strategy forward. But lastly, whether a company uses one strategy versus another generically, it's not necessarily that one strategy done well is significantly better than another strategy executed equally well. It's about what one of my friends used to call doing the right things right. So if you take a strategy and you really apply it correctly and you focus on execution, and you perform well, it's going to lead to good outcomes. If you use the perfect strategy but you executed poorly, then it's not going to lead to good outcomes. So ultimately, it is important to pick the right strategy, but execution of that strategy is more important in my opinion. You don't want to focus too much time on picking the perfect strategy and then not have enough resources to execute it, or pick a strategy that might seem like it should work well for you and you can't execute. So ultimately, you have to do the right things within your environment and perform them to the best of your abilities.
