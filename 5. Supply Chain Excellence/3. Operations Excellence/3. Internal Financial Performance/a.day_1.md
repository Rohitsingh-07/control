## Supply Chain Capital

- Now let's talk about supply chain capital. So when we think about the different places that a company can obtain capital from, typically, we're looking at things like debt, which means the company goes out and they ask a bank to give them a loan, that's debt, or they can sell a part of themselves to an outside investor, which is typically called equity. So when a company first goes public and sells their shares to everybody, it's called an IPO, an initial public offering, they issue equity. So they sell shares in the company to the public, they receive capital, and then they can grow their business. Typically, that's the reason why most companies go public, or you just have the cash available. But the fourth source, I like to call it supply chain capital, sometimes it's known as operating capital, retained earnings, and that's the link into the financial statement, but it's the profit that you generated and then you can choose to invest in your own business. We saw in the last probably even 10 years an increased need for capital, partly because debt and equity markets are more difficult than they used to be.

- A lot of banks have received heavy restrictions to the amount of lending and the type of lending they can do. So they are not as likely to write out loans for businesses, especially smaller ones. Everybody likes to give money to big successful companies, but it's the smaller companies that typically need the capital much more urgently. So there have been restrictions. The equity markets sometimes have difficulties. By going public, you also are giving up some control over your own company, and also interest rates. Sometimes if you're a smaller company, you're not able to get credit at the same rate as the bigger company could. So raising capital internally, which we call supply chain capital, or raising capital through your own supply chain is increasingly preferred way of getting cash.

## Increasing Supply Chain Capital

- Now let's talk about the increasing supply chain capital. This goes back to an idea we had, and you'll recognize it's part of our definition of supply chain financing, is to use the supply chain to fund the firm. That has to do with, for example, if you are able to get your customers to pay you faster. Maybe through some alternative funding mechanisms, you are able to get cash faster. So you decrease your accounts receivable and you increase your cash. Similarly, if you are able to delay payments to your suppliers, you increase your cash and you increase your accounts payable. So it's an additional liability, but your cash goes up at the same time.

<img width="1919" height="948" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bfb0a40-ebc8-4584-8537-66e21fd1262b" />

- So both of these sides are increasing cash within the company. Typically, what we also see is companies have five different ways of increasing retained earnings or creating additional profit that they can then use as capital. One has to do with pricing. By managing prices better, you are able to extract more revenue. The other one is SKU rationalization. By not having all that many different items available and limiting the assortment you offer to customer, you might be able to reduce cost and focus better and that might actually lead to decrease costs, which means your profit increases. Mixed management, the assortment of items that you offer to customers at the same time can also make it more likely that you sell additional items.
- So if you sell things that go together, your customer is more likely to buy things from you because instead of buying one item, now they buy two items. Generating supply chain savings. In other words, working with your suppliers to reduce costs, lowers cost of goods sold, increases profit. Then functional savings, basically, reorganizing your operation, I know we talked about that in the first two courses a little bit, are also a source of capital and it comes out of the supply chain. So that's why we call it supply chain capital.

## Fund The Growth

<img width="1919" height="952" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fab13e8-b13e-4375-9bfd-36704f58a764" />

- Fund the growth. Fund the growth is an idea that goes back to a fairly well-known company which happens to be headquarter to the nearby Rutgers University and that's Colgate-Palmolive. Colgate had this initiative for a number of years now where they are trying to create savings in their own organization that's going to fuel their growth in emerging markets. They recognized that most of their growth is only going to occur in emerging markets. In order to sell in those markets, they're going to have to invest and most of their funding is going to come internally, so they're going to raise their own capital to expand internationally. So they set up a system that is tracking savings from throughout the organization that is then to be used for that growth. It's a catchy term but it's one that has been fairly successful for the organization in terms of not having to rely on the capital markets or on issuing additional equity, and it's largely made Colgate a self-sufficient company in terms of their expansion.

## Inventory

- Now, let's talk about inventory. Inventory is one of the important things in the supply chain because that's where all of the inventory resides and that's where a lot of the inventory is managed. So it's a very important topic for both the company financially and supply chain management as a discipline. So holding inventory is not free. However, it's necessary because unless you have inventory, you don't have anything to sell. Now, you could say, well then I become a company that just manufacturers when I get a customer order. Well, that's fine, but you are going to become a very small niche company and that's always a successful way of running your company.

<img width="1919" height="946" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2140ae22-e3a1-433d-a614-1e2a2f740e72" />

- Now, if you are having to hold inventory, one important consideration is inventory carrying cost. Accountants have long calculated inventory carrying costs but in many ways, the way an accountant looks at the inventory carrying cost, they look at it as a capital cost. So in other words, the cost of inventory is equal to the amount of capital that's tied up in it. So as a way to determine what it costs to hold inventory is, what do I pay for capital to borrow, what do I pay for capital in terms of equity, and if I didn't hold inventory, then I could do something else with that money. So it's an opportunity cost driven by the cost of money. That's a very myopic way of looking at things because holding inventory isn't just tying up money, but it's also going to incur inventory service costs, for example, you have to insure the inventory, you have to pay taxes on it in some cases, then you have to account for storage costs and possibly different types of warehouses, and there's risk associated with holding inventory. It can go obsolete, it can be damaged, it can be pilfered, or you might have to move it and incur additional cost by holding it in the wrong location.
- So when you think about what it is to hold inventory and most companies are underestimating the cost they incur to hold inventory. So therefore, they're less sensitive to managing inventory carefully. So you have to be very careful with the official inventory carrying costs that your company uses unless you know that it's calculated correctly. This would be a fairly comprehensive way of doing things.
