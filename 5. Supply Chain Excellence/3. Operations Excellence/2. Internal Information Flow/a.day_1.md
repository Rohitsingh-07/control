## Internal Information Flow

<img width="1919" height="951" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e507a36-48b3-4553-92c8-c2596af17ddc" />

- Now let's move over to the internal information flow. I would like to highlight a concept in this module, and specifically this lesson about what happens in the factory in terms of data. Because in many organizations there has been a change as to how data that is captured in the factory and then subsequently used in the factory. The old way of managing a factory was not that data-driven. Factories have been around for more than 100 years, more than 200 years in some cases. So we've gotten to a point where technology, especially manufacturing technology is all collecting data, and that data has to go somewhere. We're finally seeing peers or some thought around what the factory of the future is going to look like, and there's going to be a lot of data produced.
- One of the areas where people talk about big data is the factory. There's tremendous amounts of data that are being produced just through the production process. So there is a concept called Industry 4.0, and that's the European term if you will. The US term sometimes is known as The Fourth Industrial Revolution, that is trying to predict how this is going to change how we do things. So the idea is that there's a whole data structure that is being produced by the supply chain in general. There are going to be changes in how we work with that type of data. So the key thing is there's way more data than we possibly going to be able to use, and the key thing is to extract what is relevant and leave behind what is not relevant.

## Industry 4.0

<img width="1919" height="943" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0613970-1030-4a41-a6cf-b9e29939805c" />

- So now let's talk about what is Industry 4.0 and the idea is that there were obviously a couple of Industrial Revolution. So the first Industrial Revolutions in the 18th century, in some cases 17th century, were the transition from making everything by hand to using machines, and those machines were driven by steam and water-powered mainly, there was no electricity. That was the time when a lot of manufacturing, the way we understand manufacturing now, mass manufacturing was first built, started in England and then spread throughout Europe and the United States and throughout the whole world. Now, that lasted until we had more technological advances, and that would then became known as the second Industrial Revolution, or at least Industry 2.0 as some people call it. That's when we had better logistics, we had rail, we could move information via telegraphs, and that was the advent of electric power also. So that made changes into how factories looked like because you could bring in materials a lot quicker, you had the way of communicating with your suppliers, and that was probably also the first time really supplier management came into being and modern logistics obviously and how are you structure the floor of a factory. That remained the standard for a good long time until computers really came into the factory, and that was the digital revolution.
- So that was the ability to have computers and you could see what those machines were actually doing, and that's also when the need for humans became a little less. Now, this sounds a lot like where we are today, and that's actually in many ways true for a lot of companies. Now, the fourth Industrial Revolution or Industry 4.0 has to do with, we have the Internet of things. So every little device is connected to the internet and gives out data. We also can tell where things are by geolocation, GPS, and so on. So not only are things talking to the internet automatically, we also know where they are. Sometimes we don't need a whole factory to build you something because there's this thing called 3D printing where rather than manufacture things in mass production process, we can 3D print one-off items that is just one customized product, and a lot of people think that 3D printing is going to play a fairly significant role.

- Then we also have things like smart sensor, so we know what's going on with an item as it moves through the supply chain. So sometimes you have items that require certain levels of temperature, humidity, and these smart sensors will communicate to us what happened or what is happening even in real time with an item. Then all of that data is going to be taken in because everything is telling us what is going on at all times, and we need big data analytics to understand and make sense of all of that gigantic amounts of information that we now have, and then added to that is we have the ability for augmented reality. So people who are working in manufacturing can actually use that technology to make their job easier, and it ensures that if there is manual labor involved, those people do those processes in exactly the correct manner by helping them out and guiding them throughout the process. So those six items are the cornerstones of Industry 4.0, and that's how people believe that through the use of all of these things, manufacturing will change again.

## The Automation Pyramid

<img width="1919" height="955" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7819921-318c-4b34-bdc1-e0b27b531b62" />

- So, the factory of the future is going to involve a lot of automation, so let's talk about the data that is involved in making that automation happen. Industry 4.0 is actually working a lot on the information side, and the IT side of things, because that's where they are sensing a lot of improvements to be made, or predicting them. So there is the production process which is level zero. Then there are sensors that are determining what is going on. Then there's another level of data where basically it's a level of abstraction, if you will, and that is involved in monitoring the process. Then the third level would be operations management, basically making sure the whole factory runs as it should. Then level four is supply chain planning, and level five feeds all the information back into the ERP system.

<img width="1919" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10834d29-c8eb-4a11-ac53-7f45663d63e5" />

- So, we have a lot of levels of data, and each time we go up one level of data, there's basically a summary of what is going on at the level before. So, the sensors just tell us here's what's happening, monitors are looking to make sure "Okay, if the sensors are telling us everything is okay, then that really just means that yeah, everything's okay. That's all the information that we need to know." The only time monitoring is going to give us different information is that it says something is not going according to plan. So, you then roll all of those exceptions up, and that's gets used for operations management, and so on. So, there's always a level of abstraction that is going on here. Now, there's also a lot of data flow.
- So every sensor, every device creates a data stream, and you not only have data processing, but then there's also data synthesis which has to occur. That data synthesis, that's what you can then use to make decision. The key thing is, so a lot of things are going to be automated in this, but people are still necessary to make decision, and that is the big question of how are people going to interact with this whole smart and automated factory? That's really the big question.
