Great — let’s begin **Step 1: Create the Monorepo**, and I’ll explain **exactly why this step matters**, **what it teaches you**, and **how to set it up properly** so your project mirrors a real startup data engineering environment.

---

# ✅ **STEP 1 — Create the Monorepo**

## 🎯 **Goal of This Step**

To create a **single, unified repository** that contains all the components of your data engineering pipeline:

* Ingestion
* Transformation
* Data Quality
* Orchestration
* Data Warehouse models
* Infrastructure config
* Documentation
* CI/CD

This mirrors how modern Data Engineering teams structure production-grade systems.

---

# 🔥 **WHY THIS STEP IS NECESSARY (Important Explanation)**

### **1. Teaches You How Real DE Teams Organize Production Systems**

Companies rarely have small, isolated scripts.
They have a **system** with many moving parts:

* Airflow DAGs
* dbt models
* Great Expectations suites
* Warehouse schemas
* Docs
* Infra configs
* CI/CD pipelines

A monorepo reflects that reality.

---

### **2. Forces You to Think in Modular Components**

Each folder is its **own subsystem**, just like in real pipelines:

| Component        | What it Teaches               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ingestion/       | Data extraction architecture  |
| transformations/ | SQL modeling, dbt, ELT design |
| airflow/         | Orchestration and scheduling  |
| warehouse/       | Schema design, data modeling  |
| tests/           | Quality, validations          |
| infra/           | Docker, pipelines, configs    |

This modular structure will help you understand how to build scalable systems.

---

### **3. Makes CI/CD and DevOps Behaviors Natural**

With a monorepo, you can add:

* GitHub Actions
* Pre-commit hooks
* Linting
* Automatic dbt testing
* DAG validation

Just like real-world DE teams.

---

### **4. Clean Separation of “Layers” → Teaches Data Engineering Architecture**

A DE system has layers:

* **Bronze** → raw
* **Silver** → cleaned
* **Gold** → business KPIs

A monorepo makes you keep those boundaries clean — a core DE skill.

---

### **5. Makes Your Project Portfolio-Ready (Very Important)**

Reviewers want to see:

* Structure
* Organization
* Multi-component systems

This repo structure will automatically look *senior-level*, not beginner.

---

### **6. Enables Multi-environment Setup (Local, Dev, Prod)**

You will later add:

```
configs/
  ├── local.yaml
  ├── dev.yaml
  ├── prod.yaml
```

This teaches you *environment management* — crucial for real pipelines.

# 📁 **FULL MONOREPO STRUCTURE (Use this)**

Here is the exact structure you should create:

```

│   ├── raw/
│   ├── landing/
│   ├── bronze/
│   ├── silver/
│   └── gold/

│   ├── extract/
│   ├── load/
│   └── utils/
│

│   ├── dags/
│   ├── plugins/
│   └── docker-compose.yaml
│
├── transformations/
│   └── dbt_project/

# 🧠 **WHAT THIS STEP TEACHES YOU (Crucial Skills You Gain)**

### **Skill 1 — Designing Data Platform Architecture**

You understand how real teams design:

* ingestion layer
* orchestration layer
* warehouse layer
* modeling layer
* BI layer

This is exactly what senior data engineers do.

---

### **Skill 2 — Thinking in Pipelines, Not Scripts**

You’ll understand why a random Python script is **not** a data pipeline.

This structure forces you to think in:

* dependencies
* layers
* environments
* modularity

---

### **Skill 3 — Documentation & Maintainability**

Every good DE team requires:

* README
* architecture docs
* lineage docs
* ERD diagrams

You are learning professional practice.

---

### **Skill 4 — Extensibility—The Pipeline Can Grow**

After this project, you can easily add:

* Streaming pipeline with Kafka
* Reverse ETL
* Feature store
* ML workflows

Your structure will support it.

---

# 📌 **WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW**

Create the repo locally:

### **1. Create the folder**

```bash
mkdir de-ecommerce-pipeline
cd de-ecommerce-pipeline
```

### **2. Create subfolders**

```bash
mkdir -p data/raw data/landing data/bronze data/silver data/gold
mkdir -p ingestion/extract ingestion/load ingestion/utils
mkdir -p airflow/dags airflow/plugins
mkdir -p transformations/dbt_project/models/{staging,marts,dim,fact}
mkdir -p quality/great_expectations quality/expectations
mkdir -p warehouse/schema
mkdir -p infra/docker infra/configs
mkdir -p bi/superset_dashboards
mkdir -p scripts/utilities
mkdir -p docs
mkdir -p tests/unit tests/integration
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch README.md requirements.txt .env.example
```

---

# 🎉 **DONE WITH STEP 1**

If you want, I can now help with:

### 👉 Step 2 — Download the Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset

(in the most efficient folder structure for your pipeline)

or

### 👉 Generate `README.md` with a professional structure

or

### 👉 Add `requirements.txt` + environment setup

Just tell me:

**"Let's start Step 2"**
