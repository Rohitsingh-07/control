Great — let’s begin **Step 1: Create the Monorepo**, and I’ll explain **exactly why this step matters**, **what it teaches you**, and **how to set it up properly** so your project mirrors a real startup data engineering environment.

---

# ✅ **STEP 1 — Create the Monorepo**

## 🎯 **Goal of This Step**

To create a **single, unified repository** that contains all the components of your data engineering pipeline:

* Ingestion
* Transformation
* Data Quality
* Orchestration
* Data Warehouse models
* Infrastructure config
* Documentation
* CI/CD

This mirrors how modern Data Engineering teams structure production-grade systems.

---

# 🔥 **WHY THIS STEP IS NECESSARY (Important Explanation)**

### **1. Teaches You How Real DE Teams Organize Production Systems**

Companies rarely have small, isolated scripts.
They have a **system** with many moving parts:

* Airflow DAGs
* dbt models
* Great Expectations suites
* Warehouse schemas
* Docs
* Infra configs
* CI/CD pipelines

A monorepo reflects that reality.

---

### **2. Forces You to Think in Modular Components**

Each folder is its **own subsystem**, just like in real pipelines:

| Component        | What it Teaches               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ingestion/       | Data extraction architecture  |
| transformations/ | SQL modeling, dbt, ELT design |
| airflow/         | Orchestration and scheduling  |
| warehouse/       | Schema design, data modeling  |
| tests/           | Quality, validations          |
| infra/           | Docker, pipelines, configs    |

This modular structure will help you understand how to build scalable systems.

---

### **3. Makes CI/CD and DevOps Behaviors Natural**

With a monorepo, you can add:

* GitHub Actions
* Pre-commit hooks
* Linting
* Automatic dbt testing
* DAG validation

Just like real-world DE teams.

---

### **4. Clean Separation of “Layers” → Teaches Data Engineering Architecture**

A DE system has layers:

* **Bronze** → raw
* **Silver** → cleaned
* **Gold** → business KPIs

A monorepo makes you keep those boundaries clean — a core DE skill.

---

### **5. Makes Your Project Portfolio-Ready (Very Important)**

Reviewers want to see:

* Structure
* Organization
* Multi-component systems

This repo structure will automatically look *senior-level*, not beginner.

---

### **6. Enables Multi-environment Setup (Local, Dev, Prod)**

You will later add:

```
configs/
  ├── local.yaml
  ├── dev.yaml
  ├── prod.yaml
```

This teaches you *environment management* — crucial for real pipelines.

---

# 🧠 **WHAT THIS STEP TEACHES YOU (Crucial Skills You Gain)**

### **Skill 1 — Designing Data Platform Architecture**

You understand how real teams design:

* ingestion layer
* orchestration layer
* warehouse layer
* modeling layer
* BI layer

This is exactly what senior data engineers do.

---

### **Skill 2 — Thinking in Pipelines, Not Scripts**

You’ll understand why a random Python script is **not** a data pipeline.

This structure forces you to think in:

* dependencies
* layers
* environments
* modularity

---

### **Skill 3 — Documentation & Maintainability**

Every good DE team requires:

* README
* architecture docs
* lineage docs
* ERD diagrams

You are learning professional practice.

---

### **Skill 4 — Extensibility—The Pipeline Can Grow**

After this project, you can easily add:

* Streaming pipeline with Kafka
* Reverse ETL
* Feature store
* ML workflows

Your structure will support it.

---

# 📌 **WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW**

Create the repo locally:

### **1. Create the folder**

```bash
mkdir de-ecommerce-pipeline
cd de-ecommerce-pipeline
```

### **2. Create subfolders**

```bash
mkdir -p data/raw data/landing data/bronze data/silver data/gold
mkdir -p ingestion/extract ingestion/load ingestion/utils
mkdir -p airflow/dags airflow/plugins
mkdir -p transformations/dbt_project/models/{staging,marts,dim,fact}
mkdir -p quality/great_expectations quality/expectations
mkdir -p warehouse/schema
mkdir -p infra/docker infra/configs
mkdir -p bi/superset_dashboards
mkdir -p scripts/utilities
mkdir -p docs
mkdir -p tests/unit tests/integration
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch README.md requirements.txt .env.example
```

---

# 🎉 **DONE WITH STEP 1**

If you want, I can now help with:

### 👉 Step 2 — Download the Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset

(in the most efficient folder structure for your pipeline)

or

### 👉 Generate `README.md` with a professional structure

or

### 👉 Add `requirements.txt` + environment setup

Just tell me:

**"Let's start Step 2"**

============================================================================================================================================================

Here’s exactly **where and how** to create the monorepo on your system using Command Prompt (Windows).
I'll give you two options—choose the one you prefer.

---

# ✅ **Where to Create This Repository**

You can create your project **anywhere on your system**, but the **three most common and best locations** are:

---

## **Option A (recommended): Inside your `Documents` folder**

This keeps your projects organized and easy to find.

Path example:

```
C:\Users\<YourName>\Documents\
```

---

## **Option B: Inside a dedicated `Dev` or `Projects` folder**

If you want to be organized like real developers:

```
C:\Users\<YourName>\Dev\
```

or

```
C:\Users\<YourName>\Projects\
```

---

## **Option C: Inside your Desktop**

If you just want quick access:

```
C:\Users\<YourName>\Desktop\
```

---

# 🔧 **How to Create the Monorepo (Step-by-Step in Command Prompt)**

### **1. Open Command Prompt**

Press:

```
Win + R → type “cmd” → Enter
```

---

### **2. Navigate to the folder where you want your project**

Example (Documents folder):

```cmd
cd C:\Users\<YourName>\Documents
```

Example (Desktop):

```cmd
cd C:\Users\<YourName>\Desktop
```

---

### **3. Create the repository folder**

```cmd
mkdir de-ecommerce-pipeline
cd de-ecommerce-pipeline
```

✔️ Inside this folder is where your entire data engineering project will live.

---

### **4. Create the subfolders**

Copy/paste this block into Command Prompt:

```cmd
mkdir data
mkdir data\raw data\landing data\bronze data\silver data\gold

mkdir ingestion
mkdir ingestion\extract ingestion\load ingestion\utils

mkdir airflow
mkdir airflow\dags airflow\plugins

mkdir transformations
mkdir transformations\dbt_project
mkdir transformations\dbt_project\models
mkdir transformations\dbt_project\models\staging transformations\dbt_project\models\marts transformations\dbt_project\models\dim transformations\dbt_project\models\fact
mkdir transformations\dbt_project\tests
mkdir transformations\dbt_project\profiles

mkdir quality
mkdir quality\great_expectations quality\expectations

mkdir warehouse
mkdir warehouse\schema

mkdir infra
mkdir infra\docker infra\configs infra\terraform

mkdir bi
mkdir bi\superset_dashboards

mkdir scripts
mkdir scripts\utilities

mkdir docs

mkdir tests
mkdir tests\unit tests\integration

mkdir .github
mkdir .github\workflows

type nul > README.md
type nul > requirements.txt
type nul > .env.example
```

---

### ✔️ When you’re done, your folder structure is ready.

You can confirm with:

```cmd
tree /F
```

This will print the entire directory tree.

---

# 🧠 **Summary**

### **You should create the monorepo in a place where you can easily find and manage it, such as:**

* `Documents`
* `Dev`
* `Projects`
* `Desktop`

### **Command Prompt Steps:**

1. `cd` into your chosen directory
2. `mkdir de-ecommerce-pipeline`
3. Run the folder-creation commands

---

# ✅ Ready for Step 2?

If you’re ready, say:

**“Let’s start Step 2 — Download the dataset.”**

And I’ll guide you through where to put the Brazilian E-Commerce dataset and how to organize it efficiently.
