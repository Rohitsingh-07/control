## What is Metadata

Metadata is “data about data”: information that describes, explains, or gives context to other data so it is easier to find, understand, and manage.[1][2]

## Core idea

Metadata captures characteristics of a piece of data, such as how, when, where, and by whom it was created, without being the main content itself.  For example, the title, author, and publication year of a book are metadata about that book, and the date, location, and camera model for a photo are metadata about that image.[5][8][1]

## Common examples

- Files: author, creation date, last modified date, file size, and file format for a document or spreadsheet.[2][4]
- Databases: table names, column names, data types, and relationships (keys) that describe how data is organized.[9][2]
- Web pages: HTML tags like title, description, and keywords that describe page content and help with search.[5][9]

## Main types

Many sources group metadata into a few broad categories:  
- Descriptive metadata: helps identify and discover resources (titles, authors, keywords, abstracts).[7][5]
- Structural metadata: shows how parts fit together, such as chapters in a book or links between database tables.[3][9]
- Administrative/technical metadata: supports management and preservation, including file type, rights, formats, and processes used to create or modify data.[3][7]

## Why metadata matters

Metadata improves searchability by acting like labels and indexes so people and systems can quickly locate relevant data.  It also adds context and standards, which supports data quality, governance, and long‑term usability in analytics, archives, and digital systems.[6][8][10][2][9]
