- That's awesome that you're diving into DSA and using Python! Even though the tutorial you shared focuses on C++ STL (Standard Template Library),
- Python has its own set of powerful built-in data structures and standard libraries that serve similar purposes — often with more intuitive syntax.

Here’s a Python equivalent overview of commonly used C++ STL containers and algorithms:

### 🧺 **Containers (Data Structures)**

| C++ STL             | Python Equivalent                  | Description |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| `vector`            | `list`                             | Dynamic array, allows duplicates, maintains order. |
| `set`               | `set`                              | Unordered collection of unique elements. |
| `unordered_set`     | `set` (in CPython, hash-based)     | Similar behavior, unordered and fast lookup. |
| `multiset`          | `collections.Counter`              | Allows duplicates, keeps count of elements. |
| `map`               | `dict`                             | Key-value pairs with unique keys. |
| `unordered_map`     | `dict`                             | Same as above; `dict` in Python is hash-based. |
| `multimap`          | `defaultdict(list)` from `collections` | Allows multiple values for the same key. |
| `stack`             | `list` or `collections.deque`      | Use `.append()` and `.pop()` for LIFO behavior. |
| `queue`             | `queue.Queue` or `collections.deque` | FIFO behavior. |
| `deque`             | `collections.deque`                | Double-ended queue, fast appends and pops. |
| `priority_queue`    | `heapq` (min-heap)                 | Binary heap-based priority queue. |
| `list` (C++)        | `list` or `deque` (Python)         | Doubly-linked list-like behavior with `deque`.

### ⚙️ **Algorithms**

| C++ STL                        | Python Equivalent                            | Notes |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------|
| `sort()`                       | `sorted()` or `.sort()`                      | Returns sorted list or sorts in-place. |
| `min_element()`                | `min()`                                      | Gets smallest element. |
| `max_element()`                | `max()`                                      | Gets largest element. |
| `next_permutation()`          | `itertools.permutations()`                   | Generates permutations. |
| `__builtin_popcount()`        | `bin(x).count('1')`                          | Counts number of set bits in binary. |

### 🔧 Useful Python Libraries for DSA:
- `collections`: `deque`, `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `OrderedDict`, etc.
- `heapq`: For priority queues (min-heaps).
- `bisect`: Binary search on sorted lists.
- `itertools`: Combinatorics (permutations, combinations).
- `math`: For number theory, gcd, lcm, etc.
- `functools`: For memoization (`lru_cache`).

```
# Given an integer N, return the number of digits in N.

def func(N):
    cnt = 0
    while N>0:
        cnt = cnt+1
        N=N//10
    return cnt

print(func(1298234))
```

- Time Complexity: Time complexity for this code is O(log N) where log is log to the base 10.
- The time complexity is log to the base 10 because it means how many times do I multiply 10 to get N. It gives the number of digits
- Ex: log 10 (to the base 10) = 1 | log 1000 = 3 in this case
- So here we get the number of digits of the number through this approach

- Space Complexity - O(1)

- An Optimal way to solve the problem

```
                                
                     
import math

# Calculate the count of digits in 'n'
# using logarithmic operation log10(n) + 1.
def countDigits(n):
    # Initialize a variable 'cnt' to
    # store the count of digits.
    cnt = int(math.log10(n) + 1)

    # The expression int(math.log10(n) + 1)
    # calculates the number of digits in 'n'
    # and casts it to an integer.
    
    # Adding 1 to the result accounts
    # for the case when 'n' is a power of 10,
    # ensuring that the count is correct.
   
    # Finally, the result is cast
    # to an integer to ensure it is rounded
    # down to the nearest whole number.
    
    # Return the count of digits in 'n'.
    return cnt

print(countDigits(108442))
```

- This is an optimal way to calculate because we are using a math library function to count the number of digits
- Time Complexity - O(1)
- Space Complexity - O(1)
