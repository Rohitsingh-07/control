## Reverse Digits of A Number

- Problem Statement: Given an integer N return the reverse of the given number.

```
                            
# Prompt the user to enter an
# integer and store it in 'n'.
n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
# Initialize a variable 'revNum' to
# store the reverse of the input integer.
revNum = 0
# Start a while loop to reverse the
# digits of the input integer.
while n > 0:
    # Extract the last digit of
    # 'n' and store it in 'ld'.
    ld = n % 10
    # Multiply the current reverse number
    # by 10 and add the last digit.
    revNum = (revNum * 10) + ld
    # Remove the last digit from 'n'.
    n = n // 10
# Print the reversed number.
print(revNum)
                           

OutputInput Number: 7789

Output Number: 9877

```

Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(log10N + 1) where N is the input number. The time complexity is determined by the number of digits in the input integer N.In the worst case when N is a multiple of 10 the number of digits in N is log10 N + 1.

- In the while loop we divide N by 10 until it becomes 0 which takes log10N iterations.
- In each iteration of the while loop we perform constant time operations like modulus and division and pushing elements into the vector.
- Space Complexity: O(1) as only a constant amount of additional memory for the reversed number regardless of size of the input number.

- This is another code that we got from chatgpt

```
def func(n):
    reversed_str = str(n)[::-1]  # Reverse the string
    return int(reversed_str)     # Convert back to integer

print(func(12323400))  # Output: 4321
```

- The time complexity of the 2nd code is same O(log n)
- However, for space complexity, it is taking more memory compared to the previous one. The space complexity for the 2nd code is 	O(log n) which consumes more memory compared to the first code.

## Check if a number is Palindrome or Not

- Problem Statement: Given an integer N, return true if it is a palindrome else return false.

```
# My Solution

n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

original = n
revNum = 0

while n > 0:
    ld = n % 10
    revNum = (revNum * 10) + ld
    n = n // 10

# print(original)
# print(revNum)

if original == revNum: print('Palindrome Number')
else: print('Not Palindrome')
```

For this code the Time Complexity is 	O(log n) and space complexity is O(1)

```
# Answer Code

                            
# Function to check if a
# given integer is a palindrome
def palindrome(n):
    # Initialize a variable to
    # store the reverse of the number
    revNum = 0
    # Create a duplicate variable to
    # store the original number
    dup = n
    # Iterate through each digit of
    # the number until it becomes 0
    while n > 0:
        # Extract the last
        # digit of the number
        ld = n % 10
        # Build the reverse number
        # by appending the last digit
        revNum = (revNum * 10) + ld
        # Remove the last digit
        # from the original number
        n = n // 10
    # Check if the original number
    # is equal to its reverse
    if dup == revNum:
        # If equal, return True
        # indicating it's a palindrome
        return True
    else:
        # If not equal, return False
        # indicating it's not a palindrome
        return False


def main():
    number = 4554

    if palindrome(number):
        print(number, "is a palindrome.")
    else:
        print(number, "is not a palindrome.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

This has the Time Complexity - 	O(log n) and space complexity - O(1)
