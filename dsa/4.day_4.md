## Reverse Digits of A Number

- Problem Statement: Given an integer N return the reverse of the given number.

```
                            
# Prompt the user to enter an
# integer and store it in 'n'.
n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
# Initialize a variable 'revNum' to
# store the reverse of the input integer.
revNum = 0
# Start a while loop to reverse the
# digits of the input integer.
while n > 0:
    # Extract the last digit of
    # 'n' and store it in 'ld'.
    ld = n % 10
    # Multiply the current reverse number
    # by 10 and add the last digit.
    revNum = (revNum * 10) + ld
    # Remove the last digit from 'n'.
    n = n // 10
# Print the reversed number.
print(revNum)
                           

OutputInput Number: 7789

Output Number: 9877

```

Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(log10N + 1) where N is the input number. The time complexity is determined by the number of digits in the input integer N.In the worst case when N is a multiple of 10 the number of digits in N is log10 N + 1.

- In the while loop we divide N by 10 until it becomes 0 which takes log10N iterations.
- In each iteration of the while loop we perform constant time operations like modulus and division and pushing elements into the vector.
- Space Complexity: O(1) as only a constant amount of additional memory for the reversed number regardless of size of the input number.

- This is another code that we got from chatgpt

```
def func(n):
    reversed_str = str(n)[::-1]  # Reverse the string
    return int(reversed_str)     # Convert back to integer

print(func(12323400))  # Output: 4321
```

- The time complexity of the 2nd code is same O(log n)
- However, for space complexity, it is taking more memory compared to the previous one. The space complexity for the 2nd code is 	O(log n) which consumes more memory compared to the first code.
