- In patterns, we use nested loops
- In nested loops, the outer loop is specifically for the lines (rows) and the inner loops are specifically for the columns
---

There are 4 rules while solving pattern problems
1. We always use nested loops for printing the patterns. For the outer loop, we count the number of lines/rows and loop for them.
2. Next, for the inner loop, we focus on the number of columns and somehow connect them to the rows by forming a logic such that for each row we get the required number of columns to be printed.
3. We print the ‘*’ inside the inner loop.
4. Observe symmetry in the pattern or check if a pattern is a combination of two or more similar patterns. This step is optional since it doesn't apply to all the patterns

The first pattern that we are solving is:

```
*****
*****
*****
*****
*****
```
Solution:

```
for i in range(0,5):
    for j in range(0,5):
        print('*', end="")  # The end="" prevents a newline after each *.
        # j=+1 # This line does not affect the loop behavior because j in the loop is controlled by range(0, 5). The reassignment has no impact on the next iteration.
    print()
    # i=+1 #This does not affect the outer loop because i is controlled by range(0, 5).
```

```
A more dynamic code

def print_pattern(N):
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            print('*', end="")  # The end="" prevents a newline after each *.
        # j=+1 # This line does not affect the loop behavior because j in the loop is controlled by range(0, 5). The reassignment has no impact on the next iteration.
        print()
    # i=+1 #This does not affect the outer loop because i is controlled by range(0, 5).

print_pattern(3)

```

2. The second pattern we want to solve is as follows

*
**
***
****
*****

Solution:

```
def print_pattern(N):
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(0,i+1):
            print('*', end="")  # The end="" prevents a newline after each *.
        # j=+1 # This line does not affect the loop behavior because j in the loop is controlled by range(0, 5). The reassignment has no impact on the next iteration.
        print()
    # i=+1 #This does not affect the outer loop because i is controlled by range(0, 5).

print_pattern(5)
```

=================================================================================================================================================================================================================

3. The third pattern we want to solve is as follows

1
12
123
1234
12345

Solution:
```
def print_pattern(N):
    
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        for j in range(1,i+1):
            print(j, end="")  # The end="" prevents a newline after each *.
        # j=+1 # This line does not affect the loop behavior because j in the loop is controlled by range(0, 5). The reassignment has no impact on the next iteration.
        print()
    # i=+1 #This does not affect the outer loop because i is controlled by range(0, 5).

print_pattern(5)
```

=================================================================================================================================================================================================================

4. For the 4th pattern on the website the solution is as follows:

```
def print_pattern(N):
    
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        for j in range(1,i+1):
            print(i, end="")  # The end="" prevents a newline after each *.
        # j=+1 # This line does not affect the loop behavior because j in the loop is controlled by range(0, 5). The reassignment has no impact on the next iteration.
        print()
    # i=+1 #This does not affect the outer loop because i is controlled by range(0, 5).

print_pattern(5)
```

=================================================================================================================================================================================================================

5. For the 5th pattern on the website the solution is as follows:

```
def print_pattern(N):
    
    for i in range(N,0,-1):
        for j in range(i):
            print("*", end="")  # The end="" prevents a newline after each *.
        # j=+1 # This line does not affect the loop behavior because j in the loop is controlled by range(0, 5). The reassignment has no impact on the next iteration.
        print()
    # i=+1 #This does not affect the outer loop because i is controlled by range(0, 5).

print_pattern(5)
```

=================================================================================================================================================================================================================

6.
```
def print_pattern(N):
    
    for i in range(N,1,-1):
        for j in range(1,i):
            print(j, end="")  # The end="" prevents a newline after each *.
        # j=+1 # This line does not affect the loop behavior because j in the loop is controlled by range(0, 5). The reassignment has no impact on the next iteration.
        print()
    # i=+1 #This does not affect the outer loop because i is controlled by range(0, 5).

print_pattern(6)
```

=================================================================================================================================================================================================================

7. 
```
def print_pattern(N):
    for i in range(1, N + 1):  # Outer loop for rows
        # Print spaces for centering
        for j in range(N - i):
            print(" ", end="")  
        # Print stars for the current row
        for k in range(2 * i - 1):
            print("*", end="")
        # Move to the next line after each row
        print()

print_pattern(6)
```

=================================================================================================================================================================================================================

8.
```
def print_pattern(N):
    for i in range(N,0,-1):  # Outer loop for rows
        # Print spaces for centering
        for j in range(N-i):
            print(" ", end="")
        # Print stars for the current row
        for k in range(2 * i - 1):
            print("*", end="")
        # Move to the next line after each row
        print()

print_pattern(6)
```

=================================================================================================================================================================================================================

9. For pattern number 9 we can just combine the two patterns pattern 7 and pattern 8 to get the desired output

=================================================================================================================================================================================================================

10. 
```
def print_pattern(N):
    # Upper part of the pattern
    for i in range(1, N + 1):  # Rows increasing
        print("*" * i)  # Print stars for the current row
    
    # Lower part of the pattern
    for i in range(N - 1, 0, -1):  # Rows decreasing
        print("*" * i)  # Print stars for the current row

print_pattern(6)
```
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================

11.

```
def pattern(N):
    # Outer loop for the number of rows
    for i in range(N):
        # Determine starting value (1 for even rows, 0 for odd rows)
        start = 1 if i % 2 == 0 else 0
        
        # Inner loop for printing values in each row
        for j in range(i + 1):
            print(start, end="")  # Print the current value
            start = 1 - start  # Alternate between 1 and 0
        
        # Move to the next line after each row
        print()

pattern(5)
```
