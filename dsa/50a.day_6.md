## Check if a number is prime or not

- Problem Statement: Given an integer N, check whether it is prime or not. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself and the total number of divisors is 2.

- Algorithm / Intuition
    - We can iterate through numbers from 1 to n, counting how many of these numbers divide n without a remainder. If exactly two numbers do, so n is prime otherwise it is not prime.

Algorithm:

- Step 1:Initialise a variable cnt to count the number of factors and set it to 0.

- Step 2:Start a loop from 1 to n, iterating through each number i. Inside the loop:

Check if n is divisible by i without any remainder. If it is, increment the counter variable by 1.

- Step 3:After the loop if the number of divisors is equal to 2, return true indicating the number is prime. If the number of divisors is not equal to 2 (but greater), return false indicating that the number is not prime.
