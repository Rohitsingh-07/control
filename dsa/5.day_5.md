## Find GCD of two numbers

- Problem Statement: Given two integers N1 and N2, find their greatest common divisor.

Brute Force Approach
```
                                
def find_gcd(n1, n2):
    # Initialize gcd to 1
    gcd = 1

    # Iterate from 1 up to
    # the minimum of n1 and n2
    for i in range(1, min(n1, n2) + 1):
        # Check if i is a common
        # factor of both n1 and n2
        if n1 % i == 0 and n2 % i == 0:
            # Update gcd to the
            # current common factor i
            gcd = i

    # Return the greatest
    # common divisor (gcd)
    return gcd

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n1, n2 = 20, 15
    
    # Find the GCD of n1 and n2
    gcd = find_gcd(n1, n2)

    print("GCD of", n1, "and", n2, "is:", gcd)

'''
 if __name__ == "__main__":
This is a special Python construct that means:

“Only run this block of code if this file is being executed directly, not if it’s being imported into another file.”

Why it’s useful:

It separates the function definitions from the code that runs them.

So if you import this file in another script, the print() won’t run.

This calls the function find_gcd() — which you defined earlier — with the inputs n1 and n2.
It returns the greatest common divisor and stores it in the variable gcd.

Better Approach
```                                
def findGcd(n1, n2):
    # Iterate from the minimum of
    # n1 and n2 down to 1
    # Start from the minimum of n1 and n2
    # because the GCD cannot
    # exceed the smaller number
    
    for i in range(min(n1, n2), 0, -1):
        # Check if i is a common
        # factor of both n1 and n2
        if n1 % i == 0 and n2 % i == 0:
            # If i is a common factor,
            # return it as the GCD
            return i
    # If no common factors are found,
    # return 1 (as 1 is always a
    # divisor of any number)
    return 1 # Here we have this line which would give 1 if the factors for both numbers dont have a similar number such as factors of 5 and 8


def main():
    n1 = 20
    n2 = 15
    
    # Find the GCD of n1 and n2
    gcd = findGcd(n1, n2)

    print("GCD of", n1, "and", n2, "is:", gcd)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- The time complexity for both the above codes - O(min(n1,n2))
- The space complexity for both the above codes - O(1)

The Euclidean Algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. It operates on the principle that the GCD of two numbers remains the same even if the smaller number is subtracted from the larger number.

To find the GCD of n1 and n2 where n1 > n2:

Repeatedly subtract the smaller number from the larger number until one of them becomes 0.
Once one of them becomes 0, the other number is the GCD of the original numbers.
Eg, n1 = 20, n2 = 15:

gcd(20, 15) = gcd(20-15, 15) = gcd(5, 15)

gcd(5, 15) = gcd(15-5, 5) = gcd(10, 5)

gcd(10, 5) = gcd(10-5, 5) = gcd(5, 5)

gcd(5, 5) = gcd(5-5, 5) = gcd(0, 5)

Hence, return 5 as the gcd.
```

```
                                
def find_gcd(a, b):
    # Continue loop as long as both
    # a and b are greater than 0
    while a > 0 and b > 0:
        # If a is greater than b,
        # subtract b from a and update a
        if a > b:
            # Update a to the remainder
            # of a divided by b
            a = a % b
        # If b is greater than or equal
        # to a, subtract a from b and update b
        else:
            # Update b to the remainder
            # of b divided by a
            b = b % a
    # Check if a becomes 0,
    # if so, return b as the GCD
    if a == 0:
        return b
    # If a is not 0,
    # return a as the GCD
    return a


def main():
    n1 = 20
    n2 = 15

    # Find the GCD of n1 and n2
    gcd = find_gcd(n1, n2)

    print(f"GCD of {n1} and {n2} is: {gcd}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

## Check if a number is Armstrong Number or not

- An Amrstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

```
Example
Example 1:
Input:N = 153
               
Output:True
                
Explanation: 13+53+33 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
                                        
Example 2:
Input:N = 371                
                
Output: True
                
Explanation: 33+53+13 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371
```

- My Code
```
import math

a = int(input('Enter a number: '))

c = int(math.log10(a) + 1)
k = 0

for i in str(a): 
    m = int(i)**c
    k = k+m

if k == a: print(a, 'is an armstrong number')
```

- Time Complexity: O(n * log n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

- Optimal Approach
```
                            
# Function to check if a
# number is an Armstrong number
def isArmstrong(num):
    # Calculate the number of
    # digits in the given number
    k = len(str(num))
    # Initialize the sum of digits
    # raised to the power of k to 0
    sum = 0
    # Copy the value of the input
    # number to a temporary variable n
    n = num
    # Iterate through each
    # digit of the number
    while n > 0:
        # Extract the last
        # digit of the number
        ld = n % 10
        # Add the digit raised to
        # the power of k to the sum
        sum += ld ** k
        # Remove the last digit
        # from the number
        n = n // 10
    # Check if the sum of digits raised to
    # the power of k equals the original number
    return sum == num

def main():
    number = 153
    if isArmstrong(number):
        print(number, "is an Armstrong number.")
    else:
        print(number, "is not an Armstrong number.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- Time Complexity of the above code: O(log10N + 1)
- Space Compexity of the above code: O(1)
