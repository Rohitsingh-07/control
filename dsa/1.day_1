- The course starts with programming in c++ and showing the various aspects of the code in the given language
- Topics which are covered till now are 
  1. User Input/ Output
  2. Data Types
  3. If else statement
  4. Switch statements
- All the given topics are being taught in the c++ code
- The next topic is what are arrays, strings?

- The whole idea of an array is that the datatype should be same throughout the array
- Arrays can be multi dimensional and the most frequent one are 2D arrays which says that the left index is the row number and the right index is the column number
- 2D arrays are used with solving a lot of matrix problems and a lot of graph problems

- FOR LOOP

What is a For Loop and Why is it Used?

A for loop is a control structure in programming that allows you to execute a specific block of code repeatedly. 
It's especially useful when you want to perform the same task multiple times without duplicating your code. Let's break down the essential components of a for loop:

Initialization: You declare and initialize a variable that serves as a counter. This step only happens once at the beginning.
Condition: You specify a condition that determines when the loop should stop executing.
Increment/Decrement: You define how the counter variable changes after each iteration.

- WHILE LOOP

In the world of computer programming, loops are invaluable tools that allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. One such loop is the "while" loop.

A while loop follows a simple sequence of steps:

Evaluation of Test Expression: The loop begins by evaluating a test expression.
Condition Check: If the test expression is true, the code inside the loop's body is executed.
Re-evaluation: After executing the code, the test expression is evaluated again.
Continuation or Termination: This process continues until the test expression becomes false, at which point the while loop terminates.

A while loop is a control structure in programming that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. 
A "while" loop will not execute the code at all if the initial condition is false. It relies on the condition being true from the outset for any code execution to occur.
