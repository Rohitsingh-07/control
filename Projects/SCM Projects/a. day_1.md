- Prompt 1
  
I am a Master's student at the University of New Haven pursuing Data Science. I have 3 years of work experience in the field of analytics where I worked as a Data Analyst in the Procurement Operations Analytics Team for 1.5 Years. I want to create a project for my portfolio which revolves around my previous role that is procurement operations analytics, warehouse management, inventory management and Demand forecasting. I want to create this project which shows that it is solving real world problem and not just an academic one. I want open source resources for this project which I can create and add to my resume. I want this project to be a Machine Learning project which uses Linear Regression and all the necessary optimization techniques required. I want to complete his project in 2 - 3 days. I want this project to reflect real world problems solution. Suggest me a polished prompt that I can ask Chatgpt taking reference from above

- Prompt Received from Chatgpt

*"I am a Master’s student in Data Science with 3 years of experience in analytics, specifically working as a Data Analyst in the Procurement Operations Analytics Team. I want to build a machine learning project for my portfolio that reflects a real-world business problem rather than an academic exercise. My areas of interest and past experience include procurement operations analytics, warehouse management, inventory management, and demand forecasting.

I want you to help me design a project idea that:

- Uses Linear Regression (and related optimization techniques) as the core ML model.
- Can be realistically built in 2–3 days using open-source datasets/resources.
- Clearly demonstrates how it solves a real-world supply chain or procurement problem.
- Includes details like: problem definition, dataset sources, data preprocessing steps, model building, evaluation metrics, and potential business insights.
- Provides suggestions on how I can present it on my resume and portfolio to make it stand out to recruiters.
- Please create a project outline with clear steps, dataset links, and explain how this project reflects a real-world problem solution in procurement/inventory/demand forecasting."*
