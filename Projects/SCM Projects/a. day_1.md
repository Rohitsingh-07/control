# Project Roadmap

Awesome—let’s turn your background into a tight, 2–3 day, portfolio-ready project that feels like something a procurement analytics team would actually deploy.

## Project: Demand-Driven Replenishment for Multi-Store Retail (Regression + Inventory Optimization)

## 1) Real-world problem

Procurement needs a simple, explainable demand forecast to set next-period order quantities that **minimize stockouts and holding cost** across stores and SKUs—under budget and capacity constraints—without waiting for a giant MLOps stack. You’ll build:

1. a fast, interpretable **Linear Regression** forecaster (with regularization) for daily item demand,
2. an **inventory optimization layer** (safety stock + cost-minimizing LP) that converts forecasts into purchase orders.

## 2) Open datasets (easy & feasible in 2–3 days)

* **Store Item Demand Forecasting (Kaggle)** – 5 years of daily unit sales for 50 items × 10 stores. Clean, small, perfect for quick iteration. ([Kaggle][1])
* (Optional swap) **UCI Online Retail / Online Retail II** – raw e-commerce transactions; great for crafting store-SKU daily demand, but needs more prep. Use only if you want extra realism. ([UCI Machine Learning Repository][2])
* (Bigger alternatives if you extend later): **M5 Forecasting (Walmart)**, **Corporación Favorita** (heavier). ([Kaggle][3])

## 3) Deliverables (what you’ll ship)

* `/notebooks/01_eda.ipynb` – sanity checks, leakage guardrails, stationarity, seasonality.
* `/notebooks/02_features_baselines.ipynb` – lag/rolling features + naive/seasonal baselines.
* `/notebooks/03_linear_models.ipynb` – OLS, Ridge, Lasso; time-series CV; error analysis.
* `/notebooks/04_inventory_optimization.ipynb` – safety stock + LP to allocate orders under budget/capacity.
* `/src/` – reusable forecasting + optimization functions (scikit-learn + pulp/or-tools).
* `/reports/` – brief PDF with business results (stockouts ↓, cost ↓).
* `README.md` – executive story, quickstart, results, and “How this mirrors real ops”.

## 4) End-to-end workflow (with time budget)

**Day 1 – Data & EDA (3–4h)**

* Load daily sales. Basic checks: missing days, zeros, outliers. (Kaggle dataset is clean.) ([Kaggle][4])
* Split by **time** (e.g., last 3 months = test). Define a **production cutoff date** and never use future info.

**Day 1 – Features & baselines (2–3h)**

* Per (store, item): create lags (1,7,14,28), rolling means/std (7, 28), day-of-week, month, promo/holiday proxies (if available), and store/item fixed effects.
* Baselines: Naive (yesterday), Seasonal naive (last week same weekday). Compare RMSE/MAE/MAPE/WAPE.

**Day 2 – Linear Regression models (3–4h)**

* Train OLS, then **Ridge/Lasso** to handle multicollinearity and keep it interpretable.
* Use **sliding/expanding window time-series CV** (not random KFold). Track **RMSE, MAPE, WAPE**; add **Prediction Intervals** via residual std or **Quantile Regression** (optional) for safety stock.
* Keep a **model card**: features used, CV scheme, metrics by store and item.

**Day 2 – Inventory policy + optimization (3–4h)**

* Convert forecasts to orders for horizon H (e.g., next 14 days) with **lead time L**.
* **Safety stock** per (store, item): $SS = z_{\alpha}\,\sigma_L$ where $\sigma_L$ is forecast error over lead time; choose $\alpha$ for a service level (e.g., 95%).
* Target position $TP = \text{Forecast}(L{+}H) + SS$. Order qty $Q = \max(0, TP - \text{On-hand} - \text{On-order})$.
* **LP (pulp / OR-Tools)** to minimize:
  $\min \sum c_{i} Q_{i}\;+\; h_{i}\,E[\text{excess}] + p_{i}\,E[\text{stockout}]$
  subject to:
  • $\sum \text{unit\_cost}_i\,Q_i \le \text{budget}$ (procurement budget)
  • $\sum \text{cube}_i\,Q_i \le \text{capacity}$ (warehouse constraint)
  • $Q_i \ge \text{MOQ}_i$ if MOQs apply
  • Optional vendor caps, category targets.
* Start simple: minimize purchase cost under **service level via SS** and constraints; then show sensitivity (budget tight vs. loose).

**Day 3 – Business story, visuals, and README (2–3h)**

* Metric table: Baseline vs. Ridge/Lasso by store/item; overall **WAPE** and **stockout risk reduction**.
* Two dashboards/plots: forecast vs. actual; procurement spend vs. service level frontier.
* Case study paragraph: “With a budget cap of \$X and capacity Y m³, the optimizer re-allocated orders to reduce expected stockouts by Z% with only +A% spend.”

## 5) Concrete implementation details

**Tech stack (all open-source):**

* Python, pandas, scikit-learn (LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso), statsmodels (optional), pulp or OR-Tools for LP.
* Dataset: Kaggle **Store Item Demand Forecasting** CSVs. ([Kaggle][4])

**Key modeling choices (fast + realistic):**

* **Target**: next-day demand per (store, item).
* **Features**: lags {1,7,14,28}, rolling mean/std windows {7,28}, dow, month, store/item IDs (one-hot or target encoding if needed).
* **Regularization**: Ridge for stability; Lasso if you want a leaner feature set.
* **Time-series CV**: expanding window with last 3 months as hold-out.
* **Metrics**: RMSE (ops), **WAPE** (procurement-friendly), MAPE (with epsilon for zeros), and item-weighted service-level attainment.

**Inventory layer:**

* Estimate forecast error std per (store,item) from CV residuals → $\sigma$.
* Choose service level (e.g., 95% → $z=1.645$).
* Compute safety stock & order quantities; then solve LP with **budget/capacity/MOQ**.
* Output a **ranked PO list** (SKU, store, qty, vendor, spend, service impact).

**Stretch (if time allows):**

* Hierarchical shrinkage: store-level vs global features.
* **Hierarchical reconciliation** (top-down) if you aggregate by item/store.
* Quick “holiday” proxy by flagging local spikes (if no holiday file).

## 6) How this mirrors real operations

* **Interpretable** regression aligns with what procurement leaders accept in S\&OP.
* **Service level & safety stock** are standard practice; budget and capacity are real constraints.
* **Time-aware CV** prevents leakage (a common real-world failure mode).
* Outputs are **actionable POs**, not just a forecast chart.

## 7) Citations & dataset references

* Store Item Demand Forecasting: competition description & data. ([Kaggle][1])
* UCI Online Retail / Online Retail II (optional alternative). ([UCI Machine Learning Repository][2])
* Larger retail forecasting benchmarks (future extensions): M5 (Walmart), Corporación Favorita. ([Kaggle][3])

## 8) Suggested repo README outline (copy/paste)

* **Problem**: Procurement needs demand-driven orders under budget & capacity.
* **Data**: Kaggle Store Item Demand Forecasting (5y daily sales, 50×10).
* **Method**: Linear Regression (Ridge/Lasso) + time-series CV → Safety Stock → LP for orders.
* **Results**: Ridge beats seasonal naive by X% WAPE; LP meets 95% service with budget \$B and capacity C.
* **Run**: `make setup && make train && make optimize` (or simple CLI).
* **Files**: brief table of notebooks and outputs.
* **Business impact**: fewer stockouts at same (or lower) spend; transparent tool for buyers.

## 9) Resume bullets (tailored to your profile)

* **Built a demand-driven replenishment prototype** using Linear Regression with time-series CV, reducing WAPE by **\~X% vs. seasonal naive** across 500 store-item series.
* **Operationalized forecasts into purchase orders** via safety-stock policy and a **linear program** that enforced budget, capacity, and MOQ constraints—**cutting expected stockouts by \~Y%** at the same spend.
* **Delivered an interpretable solution** with Ridge/Lasso coefficients and per-SKU error diagnostics adopted by procurement stakeholders.

# M5 Forecasting (Walmart) data

- The M5 Forecasting dataset was released by Walmart for the M5 Kaggle competition (2020). It is considered one of the largest and most realistic retail forecasting datasets ever made publicly available.

What is the M5 Forecasting Dataset?
- It contains unit sales data for 3,049 products across 10 stores in 3 states of the US (CA, TX, WI).
- Covers a time period of 1,941 days (~5 years) of daily sales.
- Includes additional features like calendar info, special events, and historical prices, making it very close to a real-world scenario.

## EDA

- Import and Load Data
- Inspect Sales Data
  - In sales data, we have id, item_id, dept_id, category_id, store_id, state_id and the dates which are in the column from d_1 to d_1913
  - 1919 columns where 1913 (all the date columns are int64) and the other 6 columns are objects
- pd.melt is used to convert the wide format data to long format data. This is useful for
  - Easier Plotting
  - Simplified Feature Engineering
  - Makes Merging with other tables easier
  - Standardizes data for ML
- Merging with calendar data to get the date
- Sanity Checks
  -
