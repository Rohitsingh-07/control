#### Prompt 1

I am a Master’s student in Data Science with 3 years of experience in analytics, specifically working as a Data Analyst in the Procurement Operations Analytics Team. I want to build a machine learning project for my portfolio that reflects a real-world business problem rather than an academic exercise. My areas of interest and past experience include procurement operations analytics, warehouse management, inventory management, and demand forecasting.

I want you to help me design a project idea that:

Uses Linear Regression (and related optimization techniques) as the core ML model.
Can be realistically built in 2–3 days using open-source datasets/resources.
Clearly demonstrates how it solves a real-world supply chain or procurement problem.
Includes details like: problem definition, dataset sources, data preprocessing steps, model building, evaluation metrics, and potential business insights.
Provides suggestions on how I can present it on my resume and portfolio to make it stand out to recruiters.
Please create a project outline with clear steps, dataset links, and explain how this project reflects a real-world problem solution in procurement/inventory/demand forecasting.

# 📊 Demand Forecasting for Inventory Optimization  
*Using Walmart M5 Sales Forecasting Dataset & Linear Regression*

## 🎯 Problem Definition
In procurement and inventory management, inaccurate demand forecasting can cause:
- **Overstocking** → high holding costs, tied-up capital, and waste (especially for perishable goods).  
- **Stockouts** → lost sales, poor customer satisfaction, and costly expedited procurement.  

**Goal:** Build a **demand forecasting model** using **Linear Regression** that predicts future product sales. The forecasts will guide procurement managers in placing optimized inventory orders, reducing both stockouts and excess inventory.

---

## 📂 Dataset
**Source:** [Walmart M5 Sales Forecasting (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data)  

- **Scope:** Daily sales of 3,000+ products from 10 Walmart stores over several years.  
- **Features:** Item IDs, store IDs, department/category, calendar events, prices, historical sales.  
- **Target:** Demand (sales units) for each product on a future date.  

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values (e.g., missing sales = 0).  
   - Merge calendar, prices, and sales datasets.  

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Time-based features:** day of week, month, holiday/event flags.  
   - **Lag features:** sales in the past 7/14/30 days.  
   - **Rolling averages:** moving average of last 7/30 days.  
   - **Price-related features:** price changes, promotions.  

3. **Splitting Strategy**
   - Use **time-series split** (train on earlier data, validate on later data).  

---

## 🤖 Model Building
- **Baseline:** Naïve forecast (use last day’s sales).  
- **Linear Regression:**  
  - Input features: time, lag demand, rolling averages, events, prices.  
  - Output: predicted demand for next day/week.  
- **Optimization Extensions:** Ridge/Lasso Regression to prevent overfitting.  
- **Business Connection:** Convert forecasted demand into **recommended order quantities** (forecast + safety stock – on-hand inventory).  

---

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** easy to interpret in units sold.  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** penalizes large mistakes.  
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error):** % error, easy for business stakeholders.  

Compare **baseline vs. regression model** to show improvements.  

---

## 📊 Business Insights
- Identify **high-error products/stores** → candidates for higher safety stock.  
- Detect **seasonal/holiday spikes** → improve procurement planning.  
- Estimate **cost savings** by reducing excess inventory and avoiding stockouts.  

---

## 🌐 Streamlit App
Create an interactive dashboard where users can:
- Select a **store and product** to view forecasts.  
- Adjust **parameters** (e.g., forecast horizon, safety stock level).  
- Visualize **historical demand vs. predicted demand**.  
- Show **KPIs**: forecast accuracy, inventory optimization impact (stockout risk reduction, potential savings).  

**Example Components:**
- Line chart → actual vs. forecasted demand.  
- Table → recommended order quantities.  
- KPI cards → MAE, MAPE, % inventory reduction.  

---

## 📝 Resume / Portfolio Positioning
**Resume Bullet Example:**  
- *“Developed a demand forecasting model using Linear Regression on Walmart M5 dataset (42M+ records), improving forecast accuracy by 20% vs. baseline. Built a Streamlit dashboard to recommend optimal inventory levels, demonstrating potential to reduce stockouts by 15% and excess stock by 10%.”*

**Portfolio README Highlights:**
- Real-world procurement context.  
- End-to-end workflow: data → model → business insights → app.  
- Interactive tool (Streamlit) for decision-making.

## 🗓️ Step-by-Step Plan (2–3 Days)
**Day 1:**  
- Load & clean dataset.  
- Engineer lag/rolling features.  
- Train baseline + simple regression model.  

**Day 2:**  
- Add Ridge/Lasso regression.  
- Evaluate using MAE, RMSE, MAPE.  
- Build business insights (plots, feature importance).  

**Day 3:**  
- Develop Streamlit app.  
- Create KPI dashboards + visualizations.  
- Polish documentation (README, portfolio write-up).
