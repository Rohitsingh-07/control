## Finding Unusual Events

- Anomaly detection algorithms look at an unlabeled dataset of normal events and thereby learns to detect or to raise a red flag for if there is an unusual or an anomalous event
- When a company makes an aircraft engine, you really want that aircraft engine to be reliable and function well because an aircraft engine failure has very negative consequences. So some of my friends were using anomaly detection to check if an aircraft engine after it was manufactured seemed anomalous or if there seemed to be anything wrong with it. Here's the idea, after an aircraft engine rolls off the assembly line, you can compute a number of different features of the aircraft engine.
